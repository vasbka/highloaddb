ZGrFfqIEwNaBmhPPY::32.71185487854541::To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story.::17/7/1908
UCrJaJbujgjZoxkWgGGjc::52.5784279653146::"Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk  and the day will last as long as you like."::16/10/1800
FLTSNZSPgHRjhXOPF::98.81449656048585::"He has no way of guessing the danger," I said to myself. "He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs..."::9/5/1969
rwcaaRvvlNmQFP::0.2860619842691703::"I cannot play with you," the fox said. "I am not tamed."::17/1/1900
lBVKkPVigJ::43.93315815207072::Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report.::19/3/2005
YxvUPbOeJQSkgvbQwYD::98.7652768608805::"You know  one loves the sunset, when one is so sad..."::1/5/1975
bjiNjSihKSYkDwlQbumLdTJ::99.12765619230254::"  Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight."::21/8/1816
fkuzBvXaXSahMgxZf::47.34709179375616::Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.::17/11/1962
gGbJLjZfrvHypUHxuS::97.5459122386098::When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter.::5/6/1907
qWdhfWdMNiTTBxikht::95.83256108351556::"She would be very much annoyed," he said to himself, "if she should see that... She would cough most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life  for if I did not do that, to humble myself also, she would really allow herself to die..."::18/11/1858
hpkRGToyDSnqTjhE::35.28404826299082::There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand.::1/11/2001
EPPfELcdQYNcMfzHHSmt::23.043772239117743::"Ah," I said to the little prince, "these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!"::23/1/1987
rAVFbhllIVwMBsSOGvmYXR::36.21947456902448::I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: "If this bolt still won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer." Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts:::14/5/1838
jJfENmZJlYAj::65.00116489033432::"Then you don't remember. This is not the exact spot."::16/4/1994
UFOelUXxDoeory::44.394197958181216::"It is a hat for salutes," the conceited man replied. "It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way."::7/10/1863
XsTsiqrtXaKmqBQZJ::1.1750923327905949::So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near::18/6/1830
edLvMojItldocmm::61.49957222558824::On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.::6/1/2007
WlVjjKrQrYScKXbhQ::51.262018481835916::At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:::9/6/1910
GaSNaAUXuzaDVtcqdr::60.61327361285159::When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand.::7/2/2010
xYlboHWrPhLIUrvr::73.49609591469827::"I am all alone  all alone  all alone," answered the echo.::16/6/1828
PRmiWwwTdrruUkCPPNoB::14.593719018338081::"No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep."::19/2/1989
ztaSrdBEYaoWWVdwcJLJQ::38.57704258245646::He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly...::25/11/1869
dRMwWJbKWUPedVRfdKAI::12.554591055872677::"Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform," the king went on. "Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable."::11/11/1943
SZzLMOFJwckQtfgvd::83.93653756077136::"Oh, where I live," said the little prince, "it is not very interesting. It is all so small. I have three volcanoes. Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never knows."::13/6/1884
EUwaKfWFiCLmcw::93.56370117614715::This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.::13/6/1965
azZJsFlblrXgZAHvDEHDWW::72.71002111802498::The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They imagine that they fill a great deal of space. They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations. They adore figures, and that will please them. But do not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I know, confidence in me.::21/4/1833
YvuTKkiMmflOwjnep::34.67786268132834::"But I am more powerful than the finger of a king," said the snake.::2/11/1819

LTiHjfTKLOhmKnp::63.27063776235787::"Ah, then," the king said. "I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order."::10/12/1918
