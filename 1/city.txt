Artondale::519012.29791802994::Mlle Bourienne and the little princess had to confess to themselves that as she was Princess Marya looked very bad, worse than ever; but it was already late. She looked at them with that expression they knew, an expression of thought and sadness. This expression did not inspire any fear of Princess Marya in them. (She never inspired that feeling in anyone.) But they knew that when that expression appeared on her face, she became silent and unshakeable in her decisions.::4/1/2014
May Creek::684947.3604596204::Before he reached the still-unfinished fortification, he saw horsemen moving towards him in the evening light of the gray, autumnal day. The foremost, in a felt cloak and peaked astrakhan cap, was riding a white horse. It was Prince Bagration. Prince Andrei stopped to wait for him. Prince Bagration reined in his horse and, recognizing Prince Andrei, nodded to him. He went on looking ahead all the while Prince Andrei was telling him what he had seen.::21/6/1938

Laurier::580768.4985010299::“But what is there to say about me?” asked Pierre, spreading his mouth into a carefree, merry smile. “What am I? Je suis un b&#226;tard! ” And he suddenly flushed crimson. One could see that it had cost him great effort to say that. “Sans nom, sans fortune †80 …And what, really…” But he did not say what really.  “I’m free so far, and I feel fine. Only I have no idea where to make my start. I seriously wanted to ask your advice.”::5/4/1994
Baltimore::519559.32792605605::Rostov saw the tears that filled the sovereign’s eyes, and heard him say in French to Czartoryski, as he rode off:::18/7/1868

Martha Lake::232912.87982725407::“And it must seem to you,” Boris said, blushing slightly, but without changing his voice or pose, “it must seem to you that all everyone is concerned with is getting something out of the rich man.”::8/9/1842
Ariel::195052.37673425957::The princess, smiling and talking with everyone, suddenly effected the transposition, and, taking a seat, cheerily settled herself.::4/1/1808
Loon Lake::341356.5034951839::Without replying either to his wife or to his mother-in-law, Pierre got ready for the road late one night and left for Moscow to see Iosif Alexeevich. Here is what Pierre wrote in his diary:::1/6/1876

Mirrormont::43423.65060876574::“I think no one has been so courtis&#233;e  as she,” Vera said, “but till recently she never liked anyone seriously. You know, Count,” she turned to Pierre, “even our dear cousin Boris, who, entre nous,  was quite, quite dans le pays du tendre… ”†351 she said, alluding to the then popular map of love.22::11/11/1934
Albuquerque::797507.3141527236::Having said that, Napoleon rode on further to meet Marshal Lannes, who was riding up to the emperor, taking off his hat and congratulating him on the victory.::18/5/1946

Tucson::991724.0241714875::Since the time of his gambling loss, Rostov had resolved to pay back the debt to his parents within five years. They used to send him ten thousand a year, but now he resolved to take only two and leave the rest to his parents in repayment of his debt.::10/7/1991
Fresno::244184.0040886848::“I told you, it’s all bumps and hollows,” the little princess repeated. “I’d be glad to fall asleep myself, so it’s not my fault.” And her voice quavered, like the voice of a child who is about to cry.::4/5/2018
Sacramento::284698.0088229053::“You’re going?” said Natasha. “I just knew it. Sonya said you wouldn’t. I knew that on a day like this you couldn’t help going.”::23/12/1806
Mesa::88123.86100579772::Sonya walked wrapped in her fur coat. She was two steps away before she saw him; she also saw him not as she had known him and had always been a little afraid of him. He was in a woman’s dress, with tousled hair and a happy smile that was new for Sonya. Sonya quickly ran to him.::8/9/1867
Allyn::450868.54580257396::“Kari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, kask&#224;,” he pattered, trying to give his voice expressive intonations.::23/9/1818

Tiger::82802.96090025497::Le petit caporal…Je l’ai vue donner la croix &#224; l’un des vieux…Vive l’Empereur!…” *394 said the voices of old and young men of the most diverse characters and social positions. The faces of all these men had one common expression of joy at the beginning of the long-awaited campaign and of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray frock coat who stood on the hill.::21/11/1991
Staten Island::740226.4795350764::Sonya fell to thinking. The question of how to write to Nicolas, and whether she should write to him, was a question that tormented her. Now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero, would it be right on her part to remind him of herself and, as it were, of the commitment he had taken upon himself in her regard.::7/8/1825
Junction City::212021.25814210004::“You know,” said Natasha in a whisper, moving closer to Nikolai and Sonya, when Dimmler had finished and still sat there, lightly thrumming the strings, clearly undecided whether to stop or begin something new, “I think that when you remember, remember, remember everything like that, you could go on until you remember what was there before you were in the world.”::7/11/1947
Blyn::146195.96528798528::“Stop joking. I wanted to talk seriously with you. You know, I’m displeased with your younger son. Just between us,” her face acquired a sad look, “there was talk about him at her majesty’s, and you were pitied…”::23/1/1961
Lakebay::599376.9878806417::That was perfectly correct, but the count, and the countess, and Natasha—everyone looked at her with reproach. “Who does she take after?” thought the countess.::15/7/1881
Tahuya::28593.347813876015::Princess Marya had long ago abandoned her book: she was sitting silently, her luminous eyes fixed on her nanny’s wrinkled face, familiar to her in the smallest detail: on the lock of gray hair that strayed from under her kerchief, at the little pouch of skin that hung under her chin.::15/5/1856
Atlanta::38367.569123765265::“Adjutant! Mister Adjutant!…For God’s sake…protect us…What’s it all about?…I’m the wife of the doctor of the seventh chasseurs…they won’t let us pass; we couldn’t keep up, lost our people…”::17/4/2009

Plain::399853.53727354243::She suddenly jumped up onto a tub, becoming taller than he, embraced him with her thin, bare arms, which bent higher than his neck, and, tossing her hair back with a movement of the head, kissed him right on the lips.::4/1/1807
Tanner::999913.8310391672::Princess Marya indeed became embarrassed and covered with red spots when they came to her. In her cozy room, with icon lamps before the icons, a young boy with a long nose and long hair and in a monk’s cassock was sitting on the sofa beside her at the samovar.::17/9/1802
Colorado Springs::116761.8335346421::Pierre smiled, but it was clear from his smile that he realized it was not the anecdote about Sergei Kuzmich that interested Prince Vassily just then; and Prince Vassily realized that Pierre realized it. Prince Vassily suddenly burbled something and left. To Pierre it looked as if even Prince Vassily was embarrassed. The sight of this worldly old man’s embarrassment touched Pierre; he glanced at H&#233;l&#232;ne—she, too, seemed embarrassed, and her glance said: “Well, it’s your own fault.”::13/5/1932
North Hill::183855.73277607004::“For them everything’s the same,” thought Nikolai, peeking into the drawing room, where he saw Vera and his mother with the little old lady.::8/5/1995
Raleigh::509839.2150571032::“Rostov! Greetings! We haven’t seen each other,” he said and could not help asking what had happened to him: so strangely dark and upset was Rostov’s face.::2/7/1922
Monse::978365.8666245871::On the thirteenth of July, the Pavlogradskies were to take part in serious action for the first time.::7/3/1914
Miami::87666.90619997996::“To the health of our sovereign emperor!” he cried, and at the same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and rapture. At that same moment, the “Thunder of victory resound” was played. They all rose from their seats and shouted “Hurrah!” Bagration, too, shouted “Hurrah!” in the same voice in which he had shouted on the field of Sch&#246;ngraben. Young Rostov’s rapturous voice could be heard above the other three hundred voices. He was almost weeping.::10/8/1963
Marlin::520859.89425632975::“But no one has, so what do you want? It’s a circulus viciosus  which we must make an effort to break out of.”::22/5/1941

Omaha::341980.30685637094::In the adjoining room, sabers, bags, pouches, open suitcases, dirty boots lay about. Two pairs of polished boots with spurs had just been put near the wall.

Oakland::338947.10042330256::“Forgive your enemy, take no revenge upon him, unless it be by doing him good. Having thus fulfilled the higher law, you will recover the traces of the ancient majesty you have lost,” he concluded and, standing up, he embraced Pierre and kissed him.::1/1/2019
Minneapolis::450451.192397898::Sonya fell to thinking. The question of how to write to Nicolas, and whether she should write to him, was a question that tormented her. Now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero, would it be right on her part to remind him of herself and, as it were, of the commitment he had taken upon himself in her regard.::9/1/1866
Wishram::550785.6416798573::The aunt received the two young people in her corner, but, it seemed, wished to hide her adoration of H&#233;l&#232;ne and rather wished to show her fear before Anna Pavlovna. She glanced at her niece as if asking what she was to do with these people. As she was leaving them, Anna Pavlovna again touched Pierre’s sleeve with her finger and said:::25/10/1926
Cascade Valley::295643.4445669618::Prince Vassily, one leg crossed high up on the other, a snuffbox in his hand, as if moved to the utmost, and as if regretting and laughing at his sentimentality himself, was sitting with a smile of tender emotion on his face. When Princess Marya came in, he quickly brought a pinch of snuff to his nose.::23/6/2012
Cathcart::774576.128864117::“Annette, for God’s sake, don’t refuse me,” the countess said suddenly, blushing, which was quite strange with her thin, dignified, and no longer young face, and taking the money from under the handkerchief.::5/6/1911
Brush Prairie::73284.99148923751::“How can one be well…when one suffers morally? Is it possible to remain at ease in our time, if one has any feeling?” said Anna Pavlovna. “You’ll stay the whole evening, I hope?”::23/12/1874
Amboy::467344.5999812287::“My noble word of honor,” said Natasha, crossing herself, “I won’t tell anyone”—and she immediately ran to Sonya.::23/12/1811
Centerville::123400.38236304473::“Je vous aime!”  he said, having remembered what needed to be said on these occasions; but the words sounded so meager that he felt ashamed of himself.::18/2/1919
Verlot::352892.52077137947::When, a long time later, the uncle rode up to Nikolai and began speaking to him, Nikolai felt flattered that, after all that had happened, his uncle still condescended to speak to him.::9/7/1925
Alstown::333817.5418186533::“Yes, but entre nous, ”*85 said the countess, “it’s a pretext. He’s come, essentially, to see Count Kirill Vladimirovich, having learned that he was so poorly.”::18/8/1951
Synarep::942072.638808334::That evening there was a reception at Countess Elena Vassilievna’s, there was the French ambassador, there was a prince who had lately become a frequent visitor to the countess’s house, and there were many brilliant ladies and gentlemen. Pierre came downstairs, strolled through the rooms, and struck all the guests by his concentratedly distracted and gloomy look.::14/10/1831
Annapolis::547423.5938464918::Rostov, standing in the front ranks of Kutuzov’s army, which the sovereign rode up to first, had the same feeling that was experienced by every man in that army—a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud awareness of strength, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this solemnity.::14/10/2005
Port Gamble::345586.6909920885::“You, my dear countess, are a notorious spendthrift,” said the count, and, kissing his wife’s hand, he went back to his study.::10/9/1823
Tulsa::396787.4378838463::Pierre, his shoulders hunched and his mouth gaping, listened to what Marya Dmitrievna was telling him and could not believe his ears. Prince Andrei’s fianc&#233;e, so deeply loved, this once sweet Natasha Rostov, to exchange Bolkonsky for that fool Anatole, who was already married (Pierre knew the secret of his marriage), and fall in love with him so much as to agree to elope with him!—that Pierre could not understand and could not imagine.::2/8/1844

Eglon::735372.3873221407::“About life, about man’s purpose. It can’t be. I thought the same, and do you know what saved me? Masonry. No, don’t smile. Masonry is not a religious, not a ritual sect, as I also thought, Masonry is the best, the only expression of the best, the eternal sides of mankind.” And he began to explain Masonry to Prince Andrei as he understood it.::15/11/1832
Paterson::29114.612728365573::The red blotches stood out still more on Princess Marya’s forehead, neck, and cheeks. She wanted to say something, but could not bring it out. Her brother had guessed right: the little princess had wept after dinner, had said she had a foreboding of a bad delivery, was afraid of it, and had complained about her life, her father-in-law, and her husband. After her tears, she had fallen asleep. Prince Andrei felt sorry for his sister.::25/1/1913

Alger::578639.7352354807::During this act, Natasha, each time she glanced at the parterre, saw Anatole Kuragin, his arm flung over the back of his seat, looking at her. She was pleased to see that he was so captivated by her, and it never entered her head that there was anything bad in it.::14/6/1808
Wichita::190798.36934060356::“To the commission on military regulations, and I have proposed that Your Honor be enrolled as a member. Only without salary.”::22/3/1845
Cleveland::177557.7066938463::Having read the letter, Natasha sat down at the desk to write a reply. “Ch&#232;re Princesse!”  she wrote quickly and mechanically, and stopped. What could she write after all that had happened yesterday? “Yes, yes, all that was, and now it’s all different,” she thought, sitting over the started letter. “Must I refuse him? Must I really? It’s terrible!…” And, so as not to think those dreadful thoughts, she went to Sonya and began sorting out patterns with her.::20/8/2008
Fragaria::66879.26553836299::It had been decided to appear at the ball at half past ten, but Natasha still had to dress, and they still had to drive to the Tavrichesky Garden.::6/2/1950

Woodmont Beach::706599.1392902823::“Countess, I am to blame before you,” Denisov went on in a halting voice. “But know that I adore your daughter and your whole family so much that I would give two lives…” He looked at the countess and, noticing her stern face…“Good-bye, Countess,” he said, kissed her hand, and, without looking at Natasha, with quick, resolute steps, left the room.::7/4/1962
Frances::744863.942755836::“Now it’s my turn to ask you ‘why,’ my dear,” said Bolkonsky. “I confess to you that I don’t understand, maybe there are diplomatic subtleties here that are beyond my feeble mind, but I don’t understand: Mack loses a whole army, the archduke Ferdinand and the archduke Karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder, Kutuzov alone finally gains a real victory, destroys the charme †190 of the French, and the minister of war isn’t even interested in learning the details!”::16/8/1851
Tampa::284544.84182073135::“Never mind, Princess, don’t worry,” said Marya Bogdanovna, “everything will be fine without the doctor.”::10/1/1842

White Swan::998800.0509149757::By telling his daughter that she was mistaken, that Anatole intended to pay court to Bourienne, the old prince knew he would rouse Princess Marya’s amour propre, and his cause (the wish not to part with his daughter) would be won, and that calmed him down. He called Tikhon and began to undress.::18/2/1825
Camano::909707.0564885531::When, after a bachelor supper, with a sweet and kindly smile, yielding to the entreaties of the merry company, he got up to go with them, joyful, triumphant cries came from the young men. At balls he danced, if there was a need for partners. The young ladies and girls liked him, because, without paying court to anyone, he was equally amiable with them all, especially after supper. “Il est charmant, il n’a pas de sexe,” *358 they said of him.::14/11/1929
Cedar Grove::439266.82425164763::“In our temples we know no other distinctions,” the grand master read, “than those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any distinction that may violate equality. Fly to aid your brother, whoever he may be, instruct him who errs, raise up the fallen, and never nurse any malice or enmity against your brother. Be gentle and affable. Arouse the fire of virtue in all hearts. Share your happiness with your neighbor, and let envy never cloud this pure delight.::21/12/1990
Winton::11460.365378526349::The expression of annoyance had already disappeared from Boris’s face; evidently having reflected and decided what to do, he took him by both hands with a particular calm and led him to the neighboring room. Boris’s eyes, looking calmly and firmly at Rostov, were as if veiled by something, as if some sort of screen—the blue spectacles of convention—had been put on them. So it seemed to Rostov.::19/3/1945
East Olympia::818250.4658867654::“Fool, the sable one I told you. Hey, Matryoshka, the sable one!” he shouted so loudly that his voice echoed far off through the rooms.::13/3/1924
Sunset Beach::189212.0003381529::“You’re a scoundrel and a villain, and I don’t know what restrains me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this,” said Pierre, expressing himself so artificially because he was speaking in French. He picked up a heavy paperweight and raised it threateningly, but at once hastened to set it down again.::1/10/1990
Belfair::601470.1269781165::“Mon cher comte, vous &#234;tes l’un de mes meilleurs &#233;coliers, il faut que vous dansiez,”  said little Iogel, coming over to Nikolai. “Voyez combien de jolies demoiselles.” *289 He turned with the same request to Denisov, who was also his former pupil.::6/3/1918
Oso::177891.32255989526::“Make a couple of marches with a pack on your back, your fancy trim will turn shabby,” the infantryman said, wiping the mud from his face with his sleeve, “or maybe it’s not a man but a bird perched up there!”::1/5/1833
Aurora::529360.4723710696::“Leave it,” said Dolokhov, though it seemed he was not even looking at Rostov, “you’ll win it back the sooner. I let the others win, but you I beat. Or are you afraid of me?” he repeated.::5/9/1889

Quilcene::41672.611213823155::The sovereign’s horse shied at the sudden shout.

Machias::457331.49968380673::Prince Andrei, leaning his elbow on the rail, looked silently down the floodwaters sparkling in the setting sun.::10/8/1819
Neah Bay::75842.30383648138::“Tomorrow we’re off, I’m giving you a place in my carriage. I’m very glad. We’ve finished everything that matters here. I should have left long ago. I have received this from the chancellor. I solicited him on your behalf, and you’ve been enrolled in the diplomatic corps and made a gentleman of the bedchamber. Now the diplomatic path is open to you.”::11/4/1910
Malo::142781.31546732565::While Prince Andrei went to report about the purple general, that general, who obviously did not share Boris’s notions about the advantages of the unwritten subordination, so fixed his eyes on the insolent ensign who had prevented him from finishing his talk with the adjutant that Boris felt awkward. He turned away and waited impatiently for Prince Andrei to come back from the commander in chief’s office.::6/5/1873
North Las Vegas::728103.3059736144::At this ball Pierre felt insulted for the first time by the position his wife occupied in high spheres. He was sullen and distracted. There was a deep furrow across his brow, and, standing by the window, he looked through his spectacles, seeing no one.::5/7/1905
Keyport::239364.9417242464::Returning late in the evening, Sonya came into Natasha’s room and, to her surprise, found her still dressed, asleep on the sofa. On the table next to her lay the opened letter from Anatole. Sonya picked up the letter and started reading it.::6/9/1951
North Yelm::886034.2732447354::“How good-looking the old man was,” said the countess, “even last year! I’ve never seen a handsomer man.”::8/3/1948
Irving::519563.29910967214::“But you’re still afraid,” the first, familiar voice went on. “Afraid of the unknown, that’s what. However much we say that the soul will go to heaven…we know that there is no heaven, but only atmosphere.”18::20/7/1963
Outlook::346215.37018872396::“No, Sonya, do you remember him so as to remember everything, remember really well,” said Natasha, with an assiduous gesture, evidently wishing to give her words the most serious meaning. “I remember Nikolenka, too, I do,” she said. “But not Boris. I don’t remember him at all.”::6/8/1860
Clinton::901516.4454201164::“Yes, of course it’s right,” said Anatole, who obviously was not listening to Dolokhov, and, with a smile that never left his face, he looked straight ahead.::6/6/1829
Evans::100901.82165615857::To the right Rostov saw the first rows of his hussars, and still further ahead he could see a dark strip, which he could not make out but thought to be the enemy. Shots were fired, but in the distance.::11/2/1945
Browns Point::413955.7930734298::Rostov explained to him that he would like to see the hussar major Denisov, who was a patient there.::14/4/1985
Chesapeake::871487.9897411544::“If you had told me long ago, mama, I would have left at once,” she said and went to her room. But, passing through the sitting room, she noticed two couples sitting symmetrically by the two windows. She stopped and smiled disdainfully. Sonya was sitting close to Nikolai, who was writing out some verses for her, the first he had ever written. Boris and Natasha were sitting by the other window and fell silent when Vera came in. Sonya and Natasha looked at Vera with guilty and happy faces.::10/11/1955
North Marysville::29074.184650632717::“I sent Uvarka to listen at dawn,” his bass said after a moment’s silence. “He says she transferred  them to the Otradnoe reserve, they were howling there.” (“Transferred” meant that the she-wolf they both knew about had gone with her cubs to the Otradnoe woods, which was a mile and a half from the house and was a small preserve.)::8/11/1905
Beaver Valley::544793.5849010388::“Can it be me, that ‘baby girl’ (as everybody said of me),” thought Natasha, “can it be that from this moment on I’m a wife,  equal to this strange, dear, intelligent man, whom even my father respects? Can it be true? Can it be true that now there is to be no more toying with life, that I’m grown up now, that responsibility is laid upon me now for my every deed and word? Ah, what was it he asked me?”::7/3/1870
Ahtanum::429284.32580975053::Having returned to Moscow from the army, Nikolai Rostov was received by all the family as the best of sons, a hero, and their darling Nikolushka; by relations as a nice, agreeable, and courteous young man; by acquaintances as a handsome hussar lieutenant, an adroit dancer, and one of the best suitors in Moscow.::4/5/1986
Gilbert::420542.3816739379::“Villains! Scoundrels!” cried the old man, pulling his face away from her. “To destroy an army, to destroy men! Why? Go, go and tell Liza.”::9/8/2006
Hyak::839898.383592636::Having said that, Napoleon rode on further to meet Marshal Lannes, who was riding up to the emperor, taking off his hat and congratulating him on the victory.::7/10/2004
Arlington Heights::622617.9425707575::After Nikolai’s departure, the Rostovs’ house became sadder than ever. The countess was so emotionally upset that she fell ill.::25/4/1834
North Sultan::423541.83395570423::“Now, Prince, you’ll find no wagons, nothing, and God knows where your Pyotr is,” said the other adjutant.::23/4/1930
Hialeah::924431.2848276456::Andrei did not tell his father that he would probably live for a long time yet. He understood that there was no need to say it.::1/11/1839
Garland::374591.77051648154::“Only fools and profligates can be unwell, my boy, and you know me: I’m busy from morning till evening, I’m temperate, and so I’m well.”::14/12/1907
Adelaide::913579.4988486083::Having looked through the dispatch, he put it on the table and glanced at Prince Andrei, clearly weighing something.::7/11/1821
Peaceful Valley::446848.00398916303::The story was very nice and interesting, especially the moment when the rivals suddenly recognized each other, and the ladies, it seemed, were stirred.::11/3/2019
Fremont::306003.64264717774::“What, he’s been reduced to a field marshal, is it, or to a common soldier? If it’s a common soldier, then he should be dressed in the proper uniform like everybody else.”::25/4/1861
Fife Heights::132972.19839127338::“That’s nonsense, silliness, rubbish,” said Nikolai, and thought: “How lovely my Natasha is! I have no other friend like her and never will. Why is she getting married? We could keep driving around together!”::2/9/1825
Manson::323215.87235978787::“Coco, you’re home, come here to me, my dearest,” the countess’s voice came from the drawing room. Nikolai went over to his mother, kissed her hand, silently sat down at her table, and began watching her hands, which were laying out cards. From the reception room came laughter and merry voices persuading Natasha.::16/10/1984
Baton Rouge::497933.5862598365::“Don’t leave!” was all she said to him, in a voice which made him wonder whether he ought indeed to stay, and which he remembered long afterwards. When he was gone, she also did not cry; but for several days she sat, not crying, in her room, not interested in anything and only saying from time to time: “Ah, why did he go?”::14/11/1804
Richmond::416678.56799613603::“Very sorry you didn’t find me in yesterday. I spent the whole day fussing about with the Germans. Went to see Weyrother to check the disposition. When Germans start being accurate, there’s no end to it!”::25/11/1884
Redondo::982984.6526322763::“I don’t believe I’ve said anything to you, Masha, about reproaching my wife for anything or being displeased with her. Why are you saying all this to me?”::17/10/1947
Waller::117221.84194345775::Mlle George, with bared, fat, dimpled arms, wearing a red shawl over one shoulder, came out into the empty space left for her among the chairs and stopped in an unnatural pose. Rapturous whispering was heard.::10/8/1836
Addy::240609.93097700767::Anna Mikhailovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess was also weeping. They wept because they were friends; and because they were kind; and because they, who had been friends since childhood, were concerned with such a mean subject—money; and because their youth was gone…But for both of them they were pleasant tears…::23/11/1927
Matlock::500463.79281361954::But the smile did not embellish Vera’s face, as usually happens; on the contrary, her face became unnatural and therefore unpleasant. The elder one, Vera, was good-looking, far from stupid, an excellent student, well-brought-up, had a pleasant voice, and what she said was correct and appropriate; but, strangely, everyone, both the guest and the countess, turned to look at her, as if wondering why she had said it, and they felt awkward.::5/11/1814
Longbranch::74693.60794877989::Having come home and told their mother how they spent the time at the Melyukovs’, the girls went to their room. They undressed, but without wiping off their cork mustaches, and sat for a long time talking about their happiness. They talked about how they would live when they were married, how their husbands would be friends, and how they would be happy. Mirrors prepared by Dunyasha since evening stood on Natasha’s table.::17/12/1977
Boise::417389.23544596584::“The execution of the duc d’Enghien,” said Pierre, “was a necessity of state; and I precisely see greatness of soul in the fact that Napoleon was not afraid to take upon himself alone the responsibility for this act.”::10/5/1842
San Bernardino::342456.1641026745::And Boris, obviously relieving himself of a painful duty, getting out of an awkward situation himself, and putting another man in one, again became perfectly pleasant.::6/1/1907
Spokane::186539.97909349497::“Well, Captain Tushin, aren’t you ashamed?” the staff officer went on. “It would seem that you, as an artillerist, ought to set an example, and here you are bootless. They’ll sound the alarm, and a fine one you’ll be with no boots on.” (The staff officer smiled.) “Kindly go back to your posts, gentlemen—all, all of you,” he added in a superior’s tone.::22/11/1870
Palmer::613588.0188509214::“Hurry up, hurry up,” thought Rostov, sensing that the time had come at last to experience the delight of an attack, of which he had heard so much from his hussar comrades.::4/5/1973
Skyway::228855.43001323572::In the eyes of the world, Pierre was a great lord, the somewhat blind and ridiculous husband of a famous wife, an intelligent eccentric, a do-nothing, but one who harmed nobody, a nice and kind fellow. Yet in Pierre’s soul all that time a complex and difficult work of inner development was taking place, which revealed much to him and led him to many spiritual doubts and joys.::19/11/1928
Des Moines::518545.58656771085::“I do,” Prince Andrei said hastily. “I said that a fallen woman should be forgiven, but I did not say that I could forgive. I cannot.”::8/3/1875
Modesto::56876.7628004534::But the supply soldier, paying no heed the denomination of general, shouted at the soldiers who blocked his way:::25/12/1869
Nine Mile Falls::539118.0289475552::“Only, please, when I’m entertaining the guests,” said Vera, “don’t interrupt me, because I know how to entertain each of them and what to say in all kinds of company.”::17/8/1928
Birmingham::58466.76034454046::“My God, I’m a dishonest, lost man. A bullet in the head is all that’s left for me, not singing,” he thought. “Go away? but where? Never mind, let them sing!”::5/6/1889
Tacoma::137547.51215977213::“No, no, not a hair’s breadth,” Prince Vassily replied, laughing. “‘Sergei Kuzmich…from all sides. From all sides, Sergei Kuzmich.’ Poor Vyazmitinov just couldn’t get any further. He took up the letter several more times, but as soon as he said ‘Sergei’…sobs…‘Ku…zmi…ch’—tears…and ‘from all sides’ was drowned in weeping, and he couldn’t go on. And again his handkerchief, and again ‘Sergei Kuzmich, from all sides,’ and tears…so that they finally asked someone else to read it.”::10/12/1876
Fontana::938172.3365382906::It was long since Rostov had experienced such enjoyment from music as on that day. But as soon as Natasha finished her barcarolle,  reality again reminded him of itself. Saying nothing, he left and went downstairs to his room. A quarter of an hour later, the old count, merry and content, came home from the club. Nikolai, hearing him come, went to him.::24/12/1833
Cavalero Corner::309253.4748910004::The stretchers began to move. At every jolt he again felt unbearable pain; his feverish state worsened, and he became delirious. Those reveries of his father, wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had experienced on the night before the battle, the figure of the little, insignificant Napoleon, and the lofty sky over it all, constituted the main basis for his feverish imaginings.::12/10/1807
Lilliwaup::555217.6408569728::On one of his estates of three hundred souls, the peasants were registered as free plowmen (this was one of the first examples in Russia), on some others the corv&#233;e was replaced by quitrent.2 A trained midwife was invited to Bogucharovo at his expense to help women in childbirth, and a priest was paid to teach the children of the peasants and servants to read and write.::3/1/1853
Rochester::152597.92880765488::The squadron crossed the bridge and moved out of the range of fire without losing a single man. After them the second squadron, forming a line, also crossed, and the last Cossacks cleared off from that side.::3/4/1899
Sheridan Beach::622494.6984399048::“Only, please, when I’m entertaining the guests,” said Vera, “don’t interrupt me, because I know how to entertain each of them and what to say in all kinds of company.”::9/4/1862
Lincoln::613255.8674741035::“But what has happened between you?” she asked. “What has he told you? Why can’t he visit our house?”::14/7/1855
Markham::671853.8430360578::Sonya, Natasha, Petya, Anna Mikhailovna, Vera, the old count embraced him; servants and maids filled the room, talking and ah-ing.::18/10/1843
Eltopia::44548.36815080765::“Boris, come here,” she said with a significant and sly air. “There’s something I must tell you. Here, here,” she said and led him to the conservatory, to the place between the tubs where she had been hiding. Boris, smiling, followed her.::13/11/1971
Oxnard::312997.92291775055::“The one thing that’s hard for me—to tell you the truth, Andr&#233;—is father’s way of thinking in the religious respect. I don’t understand how a man with such an enormous intellect cannot see what is clear as day and can be so deluded. That constitutes my one unhappiness. But here, too, I’ve seen a shade of improvement recently. His mockery recently hasn’t been so biting, and there’s a monk whom he received and with whom he spoke for a long time.”::5/4/1926
Greenwater::714604.7268496152::“Andr&#233;,” said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish tone in which she addressed others, “what a story the viscount told us about mademoiselle  George and Bonaparte!”::2/8/1979
Copalis Beach::310267.2016907587::This view of things, widely spread in the higher spheres of the army, found support both in Petersburg and in the chancellor Rumyantsev, who, for other reasons of state, was also for peace.::3/11/1831
Roosevelt::262151.86400534096::“Don’t leave!” was all she said to him, in a voice which made him wonder whether he ought indeed to stay, and which he remembered long afterwards. When he was gone, she also did not cry; but for several days she sat, not crying, in her room, not interested in anything and only saying from time to time: “Ah, why did he go?”::14/1/1907
Moreno Valley::654629.9939135079::When Pierre returned to Moscow, he was handed a letter from Marya Dmitrievna, who asked him to come to her on a very important matter concerning Andrei Bolkonsky and his fianc&#233;e. Pierre had been avoiding Natasha. It seemed to him that he had a stronger feeling for her than a married man ought to have for his friend’s fianc&#233;e. Yet some sort of fate constantly brought them together.::14/12/1951
Summit::349157.6863576781::“He’s here now, tell him…to for…forgive me.” She stopped and began to breathe still more rapidly, but she did not cry.::3/6/1844
Ohop::875576.7485691902::“Yes. Wait…I…saw him,” Sonya said involuntarily, still not knowing who Natasha meant by him: him  Nikolai, or him  Andrei.::13/4/1987
Fayetteville::386988.6422833565::Prince Andrei inclined his head to indicate that he had understood from the first word not only what had been said, but also what Kutuzov had wished to tell him. He gathered up the papers and, making a general bow, stepping softly over the carpet, went out to the waiting room.::11/11/1949
Beverly::710451.5096824927::Each dog knew its master and its name. Each hunter knew his task, place, and purpose. As soon as they went beyond the fence, everybody, with no noise or talk, spread out evenly and calmly along the road and field leading to the Otradnoe woods.::24/4/1820
Aurora::654377.6318048242::“Sire, je vous demande la permission de donner la L&#233;gion d’honneur au plus brave de vos soldats,” *333 said a sharp, precise voice, articulating every letter.::24/6/1911
Lake Roesiger::689779.1314553873::Rostov went to the front hall again and noticed that there were already many officers and generals in full-dress uniform past whom he would have to walk.::5/12/1966
Fern Prairie::845023.9560564528::“I’ve heard about cases of that sort, and I know that the sovereign is very severe on such occasions. I think it should not get as far as his majesty. In my opinion, it would be better to ask the corps commander directly…But generally I think…”::21/6/1910
Glendale::910354.9164717852::“Oh! it’s terrible to feel myself so much in this man’s power,” thought Rostov. Rostov knew what a blow he would deal to his father, to his mother, in announcing this loss; he knew what happiness it would be to be delivered of it all, and he realized that Dolokhov knew he could deliver him from this shame and grief, but still wanted to play with him as a cat plays with a mouse.::16/1/1974
Gifford::589672.3538791134::“Ah, well, how about that! I got everything confused. There are so many relations in Moscow! You’re Boris…yes. So we’ve finally straightened it out. Well, what do you think of the Boulogne expedition? Won’t the English be in trouble if Napoleon crosses the channel? I think the expedition is very important. If only Villeneuve doesn’t botch it!”31::25/3/1970
Yonkers::52229.29661714337::“Well, let’s give it a try, Captain, see how far it will carry!” said the general, turning to the artillerist. “Have some fun out of boredom.”::24/11/1813
Burton::76866.29912460396::He began to listen, and heard the sounds of approaching hoofbeats and the sound of voices speaking French. He opened his eyes. Over him again was that same lofty sky with floating clouds rising still higher, through which showed the blue of infinity. He did not turn his head and did not see those who, judging by the sounds of hoofs and voices, had ridden up to him and stopped.::4/1/1901
Huntington Beach::829562.4422734154::Pierre, who was becoming more and more agitated during this conversation, got up and went over to the princess. He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was about to start crying himself.::24/9/1877
Carrolls::81022.09484250922::In the middle of the way, Nikolai handed the horses over to the coachman, ran to Natasha’s sleigh for a moment, and stood on the fender.::21/7/1976
Bayne::985599.4317898143::“Never mind, Princess, don’t worry,” said Marya Bogdanovna, “everything will be fine without the doctor.”::23/5/1811
East Cathlamet::344420.9239599314::“And where’s the fur coat?” said Dolokhov. “Hey, Ignashka! Go to Matryona Matveevna, ask for her sable coat. I’ve heard how people elope,” Dolokhov said, winking. “She’ll come running out more dead than alive, in whatever she had on at home; if there’s any dawdling—there’ll be tears, and papa and mama, and she’ll get cold and go back. You must wrap her in a fur coat at once and carry her to the sleigh.”::17/3/1965
Purdy::229282.98700610362::“I’m not afraid,” Sonya’s voice replied, and her little feet, screeching and squeaking in their thin shoes, went down the path towards Nikolai.::18/8/1997
Kapowsin::879922.664860737::“All right,” said Pierre, looking at Dolokhov, who, holding the bottle of rum in his hand, was approaching the window, through which the light of the sky could be seen and the glow of morning and evening merging in it.::23/1/2015
Ketron::843000.3800826716::The French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kutuzov, were shooting at him. With this volley, the regimental commander seized his leg; several soldiers fell, and an ensign holding a standard let it drop from his hands; the standard wavered and fell, stopped momentarily by the bayonets of the soldiers around it. The soldiers began firing without any orders.::18/11/1882
Montgomery::675418.0078503218::“Imagine, we got into the front line! Our regiment went into an attack!” said Boris, smiling that happy smile which occurs in young men who have been under fire for the first time.::17/7/1959
Shore Acres::60879.99589544635::Miloradovich turned his horse sharply and placed himself slightly behind the sovereign. The Apsherontsy, excited by the presence of the sovereign, marched past the emperors and their suite at a dashingly brisk pace, beating their feet.::1/1/1938
Clear Lake::520285.3620814967::Prince Andrei started to object and demonstrate his own plan, which might have been just as good as Weyrother’s, but had the shortcoming that Weyrother’s had already been approved. As soon as Prince Andrei began to demonstrate the disadvantages of the latter and the advantages of his own, Prince Dolgorukov stopped listening to him, and gazed absentmindedly not at the map, but at Prince Andrei’s face.::13/8/2012
Amarillo::256819.27608609822::Boris smiled almost imperceptibly, listening to his mother. He laughed meekly at her simple-hearted slyness, but he listened to her and occasionally questioned her attentively about the Penza and Nizhni Novgorod estates.::1/9/1938
Little Rock::398764.9003812669::“Of course you don’t,” said Vera, “because there can never be anything bad in my actions. But I shall tell mama how you behave with Boris.”::22/5/2018
Ardenvoir::598970.0299732344::And with brisk steps, as usual, he entered the drawing room, took everyone in with a quick glance, noticed the little princess’s change of dress, the ribbon on Bourienne, and Princess Marya’s ugly hairstyle, and the smiles of Bourienne and Anatole, and his daughter’s solitude amidst the general conversation. “Got herself up like a fool!” he thought, looking spitefully at his daughter. “No shame! And he doesn’t even want to know her!”::16/1/1931
Ellisport::149072.61982240583::In all, fifty-four hounds were led out under six kennelmen and whippers-in. Besides the gentlemen, there were eight borzoi handlers, around whom roamed more than forty borzois, so that, with the gentlemen’s packs, there were about a hundred and thirty dogs in the field and twenty mounted hunters.::17/6/1837
Akron::889598.660266821::“Well, dear princess, here I’ve brought you my singer,” said the count, scraping and looking around uneasily, as if fearing the old prince might walk in. “I’m so glad you’ll be getting acquainted. A pity, a pity the prince is unwell,” and, having said a few more general phrases, he got up. “If you will permit me, Princess, to deposit my Natasha here for a quarter of an hour, I’ll drive over to the Dogs’ Square, just two steps away, to see Anna Semyonovna, and come back for her.”::25/3/1991
Danville::373775.13013502886::“No, Sonya, I can’t anymore!” said Natasha. “I can’t conceal it from you anymore. You know, we love each other!…Sonya, darling, he writes…Sonya…”::18/5/2000
Hazelwood::517367.0409274931::In Mrs. Akhrosimov’s front hall, the valet, helping Pierre out of his fur coat, said that Marya Dmitrievna asked him to come to her bedroom.::16/12/1842
Holly::326924.761694652::“Yes. And do you remember how papa in his dark blue overcoat fired a gun on the porch?” Smiling with pleasure, they went through their memories, not sad, old people’s memories, but poetic, youthful ones, those impressions from the very distant past where dream merges with reality, and they laughed softly, rejoicing at something.::25/6/1802
Valley::399604.5151088687::Natasha took up the cause of reconciliation and brought it to a point where Nikolai obtained his mother’s promise that Sonya would not be oppressed, and promised himself that he would not undertake anything in secret from his parents.::25/8/1850
Columbus::165272.4553720809::Prince Andrei, without raising his eyes, hastily rode away from the doctor’s wife, who was calling him her savior, and, recalling with disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene, rode on towards the village where he had been told the commander in chief was.::14/4/1997
Augusta::444680.9791942137::And Natasha, spreading her big mouth and looking perfectly ugly, started howling like a baby, not knowing the reason why, only because Sonya was crying. Sonya wanted to raise her head and reply, but could not and buried herself still more. Natasha wept, sitting on the blue featherbed and embracing her friend. Gathering her forces, Sonya sat up and began wiping away her tears and telling her story.::12/2/1873
Grand Rapids::760035.6092519679::After the first monologue, the whole company stood up and surrounded Mlle George, expressing their rapture.::9/2/1824
Rice::716810.9115528897::“Yes, nice, nice children,” agreed the count, who always resolved all tangled questions by finding everything nice. “Just look at him! Decided to be a hussar! Well, what do you want, ma ch&#232;re !”::2/6/2012
Shreveport::783711.1529402186::“Well, Sonya,” she said, and went out to the very middle of the reception room, where, in her opinion, the resonance was best. Raising her head, lowering her lifelessly hanging arms as dancers do, Natasha made a few energetic steps from heel to toe in the middle of the room and stopped.::10/7/1881
Salt Lake City::212649.98930411992::“Et moi qui ne me doutais pas!…”  exclaimed Princess Marya. “Ah! Andr&#233;, je ne vous voyais pas.” ‡160::6/5/1974
Virginia::816082.974499381::Rostov saw the tears that filled the sovereign’s eyes, and heard him say in French to Czartoryski, as he rode off:::22/12/1869
Huntsville::660128.9748230143::“And the prisoners he killed in Africa?”19 said the little princess. “It’s terrible!” And she shrugged her shoulders.::22/7/1865
Mobile::710248.3146844107::“Crew, to your pieces!” the officer commanded, and in a minute the artillery crew ran merrily from their campfires and loaded up.::11/4/1905
Tallahassee::956477.5831978065::“Leave it,” said Dolokhov, though it seemed he was not even looking at Rostov, “you’ll win it back the sooner. I let the others win, but you I beat. Or are you afraid of me?” he repeated.::8/7/1940
North City::618761.4791486667::“See what egoists all men are; all, all egoists! For the sake of his whims, God knows why, he abandons me, he locks me up in the country alone.”::12/12/1835
Hazel Dell::550521.403318949::Mitenka, that nobleman’s son, brought up by the count, who now managed all his affairs, came into the room with quiet steps.::9/11/1875
Grand Prairie::884791.0070536907::On entering the village, he got off his horse and went to the first house, intending to rest for at least a moment, eat something, and bring clarity to all these insulting, tormenting thoughts. “These are not troops, they’re a mob of ruffians,” he was thinking as he went to the window of the first house, when a familiar voice called his name.::24/7/1909
Overland Park::513108.44819238124::What produced this extraordinary event? What were its causes? Historians say with na&#239;ve assurance that the causes of this event were the offense inflicted upon the duke of Oldenburg, the non-observance of the Continental System,1 Napoleon’s love of power, Alexander’s firmness, diplomatic mistakes, and so on.::22/9/2015
Randle::735696.407619139::“Well, why are you silent? Who have you got there dressed up like a Hungarian?” the regimental commander joked sternly.::16/5/2005
Knoxville::582472.5327992382::The princess, holding the dog on her lap with her dry, thin hands, looked attentively into Prince Vassily’s eyes; but it was evident that she would not break the silence with a question, even if she had to remain silent till morning.::6/10/1872
Snoqualmie Pass::186175.9430845157::During the entr’acte there was a gust of cold in H&#233;l&#232;ne’s box, the door opened, and Anatole came in, ducking his head and trying not to snag on anyone.::20/7/1958
Bangor::652660.4906584589::“And what’s going on with us, brother! Terrible! I confess, brother, we laughed at Mack, and yet it’s going much worse for us,” said Nesvitsky. “But sit down, eat something.”::21/6/1832
Thorp::818799.2595457265::“I have the pleasure of speaking with Count Bezukhov, if I’m not mistaken,” the traveler said unhurriedly and loudly. Pierre looked silently and questioningly at his interlocutor through his spectacles.::4/2/1831
Tahlequah::640470.4797079929::“I sent Uvarka to listen at dawn,” his bass said after a moment’s silence. “He says she transferred  them to the Otradnoe reserve, they were howling there.” (“Transferred” meant that the she-wolf they both knew about had gone with her cubs to the Otradnoe woods, which was a mile and a half from the house and was a small preserve.)::17/11/1845
Port Saint Lucie::793284.758300087::The count and Semyon looked at him. Suddenly, as often happens, the sound of the chase instantly drew close, as if the dogs’ baying muzzles and Danilo’s hallooing were just in front of them.::8/12/1878
Worcester::906307.5488295689::Prince Andrei, with a radiant, rapturous face, renewed towards life, stopped before Pierre and, not noticing his sad face, smiled at him with the egoism of happiness.::19/5/1881
Dalkena::774067.6520359252::“Here are her letters,” he said, “and her portrait.” He took the bundle from the table and handed it to Pierre.::4/1/1876
Leland::715365.3282164816::“Why is it, I often wonder,” she began, in French as always, hurriedly and fussily sitting down in the armchair, “why is it that Annette has never married? How stupid you all are, messieurs,  not to have married her. Forgive me, but you understand nothing about women. You’re such an arguer, M’sieur Pierre.”::2/7/2017
Fruitvale::774557.7430789856::No one in the house ordered so many people around or gave them so much work as Natasha. She could not look at people indifferently, without sending them somewhere. It seemed as if she were testing whether any of them would get angry or upset with her, but people liked carrying out Natasha’s orders as they did no one else’s. “What shall I do? Where shall I go?” thought Natasha, walking slowly down the corridor.::19/10/1904
Port Hadlock::826950.5142656224::“Some hot little fire for the infantry! Keep well, dear countrymen, thanks for the fire, we’ll pay it back with interest,” he said, carrying the burning brand somewhere into the darkness.::13/8/1870
Brownsville::423428.85683961865::In the evening, left alone in a new place, he could not fall asleep for a long time. He read, then put out the candle, but lit it again. The room, with the shutters closed from inside, was hot. He was vexed with this stupid old man (as he called Rostov), who had detained him, assuring him that the necessary papers had not yet been brought from town, and vexed with himself for having stayed.::4/10/2003
Tempe::826827.6662245792::“Do you remember me?” Boris said quietly, with a pleasant smile. “I’ve come to see the count with my mother, but it seems he’s not entirely well.”::9/10/1981
Deep River::235582.71102113425::“Mais qu’on ne fasse pas de mal &#224; mon petit cheval,”  the Alsatian said good-naturedly to Rostov, when the horse was handed over to the hussar.::21/5/1935
Elberton::626460.2754384737::“More, more, step it up!” he addressed these sounds mentally, and again started riding along the line, penetrating further and further into the area of the troops already going into action.::6/12/1887
Kingston::158774.31896633698::“Let’s go, let’s go!” Rostov said hastily, and, lowering his eyes and shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed through the line of those reproachful and envious eyes directed at him as he left the room.::16/11/1903
Santa Clarita::550175.696571167::“It comes over him, Your Excellency, some days,” said the captain. “He’s clever, and learned, and kind. And then he’s a beast. In Poland he all but killed a Jew, if you want to know…”::1/12/1810
Newport News::150477.89788821308::“Wait, he’s not drunk. Give me a bottle,” said Anatole, and taking a glass from the table, he went up to Pierre.::15/11/1962
Donald::447889.31191115757::“So she went. Suddenly there was a strong wind. The girl lost her hat, and her long hairs came undone…”::17/10/1855
Miles::196910.80554375885::“Well, that’s it, that’s it,” the general said angrily, taking the glass from his eye and shrugging his shoulders, “that’s it, they’re going to fire on the crossing. And what are they dawdling for?”::10/9/2004
Cape Coral::452465.72368957096::“It seems I chose the wrong time,” he said. “I wouldn’t have come, but I’m on business,” he said coldly…::21/11/1905
Joyce::200812.0591769107::“I’ve never enjoyed myself so much in my life!” she said, and Prince Andrei noticed how her thin arms rose quickly to embrace her father and at once dropped again. Natasha was happier than she had ever been before in her life. She was in that highest degree of happiness when a person becomes perfectly kind and good, and does not believe in the possibility of evil, unhappiness, and grief.::4/11/1845
Eagledale::816885.6113535087::Princess Marya wrote that she was in despair because of the misunderstanding that had occurred between them. Whatever her father’s feelings were, wrote Princess Marya, she asked Natasha to believe that she could not but love her as the one chosen by her brother, for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice everything.::5/6/1816
Port Ludlow::398116.67652278923::“But why these secrets? Why doesn’t he come to the house?” Sonya kept asking. “Why doesn’t he seek your hand directly? Prince Andrei gave you full freedom, if that’s how it is; but I don’t believe it. Natasha, have you thought what secret reasons  there might be?”::11/9/2017
Loomis::995353.5823761722::And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed for Prince Andrei all his former interest in the reforms being carried out. That same day Prince Andrei was supposed to dine at Speransky’s “en petit comit&#233;,” *348 as the host had said when inviting him. This dinner in the circle of family and friends of the man whom Prince Andrei so admired had formerly interested him very much, the more so as he had not yet seen Speransky in his domestic surroundings; but now he did not want to go.::7/5/1852
New London::951696.2184468164::From behind the door came the regular sounds of a lathe. The princess timidly pulled the easily and smoothly opening door and stopped in the doorway. The prince was working at the lathe and, having glanced at her, went on with what he was doing.::22/9/1860
Desert Aire::930496.1613675271::“‘Je leur ai montr&#233; le chemin de la gloire,’”  he said after a short silence, again repeating the words of Napoleon, “‘ils n’en ont pas voulu; je leur ai ouvert mes antichambres, ils se sont pr&#233;cipit&#233;s en foule…’ Je ne sais pas &#224; quel point il a eu le droit de le dire.” †55::8/10/1886
Providence::719701.116810632::Rostov lay down again on his bed and thought with pleasure: “Let him fuss and bustle now, I’ve done my job and I’m lying down—that’s splendid!” Through the wall he heard that, besides the sergeant major, Lavrushka, Denisov’s pert and roguish lackey, was also talking. Lavrushka was telling something about some sort of wagons, biscuits, and oxen he had seen when he went for provisions.::10/2/1963
Cedonia::548127.274753175::“And the other one’s not here! They’ve already spread the gossip,” he thought about the little princess, who was not in the dining room.::22/3/1833
Union::359876.3747572695::“I put down” (he spoke in French so that the Englishman would understand him, and he did not speak the language all that well), “I put down fifty imperials—want to make it a hundred?” he added, addressing the Englishman.::21/8/1804
Suquamish::840016.4172300245::From behind the door came the regular sounds of a lathe. The princess timidly pulled the easily and smoothly opening door and stopped in the doorway. The prince was working at the lathe and, having glanced at her, went on with what he was doing.::6/10/1986
Deep Creek::736539.652764456::As soon as the curtain rose, the boxes and parterre all fell silent, and all the men, old and young, in uniforms and tailcoats, all the women, in precious stones on bare bodies, with greedy curiosity turned their attention to the stage. Natasha also began to look.::22/9/1939
Yoman::536870.7676296827::In all, fifty-four hounds were led out under six kennelmen and whippers-in. Besides the gentlemen, there were eight borzoi handlers, around whom roamed more than forty borzois, so that, with the gentlemen’s packs, there were about a hundred and thirty dogs in the field and twenty mounted hunters.::14/9/1925
Cordell::296743.7495666879::“Well, what is it, my friend, do you still want to be an adjutant? I’ve been thinking about you meanwhile.”::25/10/1899
Fort Lauderdale::119979.17393866986::“What do you mean?” asked the countess, as if she did not know what the guest was talking about, though she had already heard the cause of Count Bezukhov’s distress a good fifteen times.::21/3/2010
Chattanooga::604135.391559919::But two weeks after his departure, just as unexpectedly for those around her, she recovered from her moral illness and became the same as before, only with a changed moral physiognomy, as children get up with a different face after a prolonged illness.::23/5/1847
Rancho Cucamonga::876334.3407950894::In the evening, when they all began to disperse after supper, Anatole kissed Princess Marya’s hand. She did not know herself how she had boldness enough, but she glanced straight at the beautiful face as it approached her nearsighted eyes. After the princess, he went to kiss Mlle Bourienne’s hand (this was improper, but he did everything so confidently and simply), and Mlle Bourienne blushed and glanced fearfully at the princess.::4/7/2019
Oceanside::159832.8954117154::He opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of the night hung three feet above the light from the coals. A dust of falling snow flew through that light. Tushin did not return, the doctor did not come. He was alone, only some little soldier now sat naked on the other side of the fire, warming his thin, yellow body.::17/5/1842
Santa Rosa::257595.41836720312::“And how does he look at the matter now?” asked Pierre, meaning the old prince. Princess Marya shook her head.::3/12/1828
Boise::172508.11601803295::“I ordered you not to let them eat that root, Mashka’s or whatever!” shouted Denisov. “I saw it myself, Lazarchuk was bringing some from the fields.”::10/9/1992
Garden Grove::822208.4175169773::“I bid you welcome. I know, I know,” said the count, kissing and embracing Denisov. “Nikolushka wrote to us…Natasha, Vera, here’s Denisov.”::21/2/1904
Vancouver::631085.7199729043::A minute later the marshal’s adjutant, M. de Castries, came in and led Balashov to the lodgings prepared for him.::18/2/1907
Ridgecrest::701147.0594566332::“One thing I don’t understand,” the old man went on. “Who’s going to work the land if they’re freed? Writing laws is easy, but governing is difficult. It’s the same thing I ask you now, Count: who will be the heads of departments if everybody has to take examinations?”::14/9/1954
Freeman::84335.07917185934::Weyrother again smiled that same ironic smile, which said that to him  it was ridiculous and strange to meet objections from Russian generals and prove that of which he was not only all too well assured himself, but of which he had assured the two emperors.::8/1/1997
Dallesport::875932.2081351528::“We’ve been asking and asking, Your Honor,” said the old soldier, his lower jaw trembling. “He passed away this morning. We’re people, too, not dogs…”::2/8/1990
Sioux Falls::740983.7609241261::That same evening Pierre went to the Rostovs to carry out his errand. Natasha was in bed, the count was at the club, and Pierre, having delivered the letters to Sonya, went to see Marya Dmitrievna, who was interested to know how Prince Andrei had taken the news. Ten minutes later, Sonya came into Marya Dmitrievna’s room.::19/11/1987
Ontario::22121.42565048414::The doctor was silent, raising his eyes and shoulders with a quick movement. Anna Mikhailovna, with exactly the same movement, raised her shoulders and eyes, almost closing them, sighed, and walked away from the doctor towards Pierre. She addressed Pierre with special respectfulness and tender sorrow.::13/1/2019
Sisco Heights::668227.2981608629::“Bon, je vous laisse dans votre petit coin. Je vois que vous y &#234;tes tr&#232;s bien,” *230 said the voice of Anna Pavlovna.::3/5/1802

Kennard Corner::411721.42812718806::“And if I should meet His Majesty before the commander in chief, Your Excellency?” asked Rostov, holding his hand to his visor.::7/4/1909
Benge::60550.71104432941::“Quant &#224; celui, Sire,”  Paulucci went on desperately, as if unable to restrain himself, “qui &#224; conseill&#233; le camp de Drissa, je ne vois pas d’autre alternative que la maison jaune ou le gibet.” *421 Not hearing out and as if not listening to the Italian’s words, the sovereign, having recognized Bolkonsky, graciously addressed him:::22/2/1978
McKinney::24730.37064718653::Seeing the Russian general, he threw back his head with its curled, shoulder-length hair in a kingly manner and gave the French colonel a questioning glance. The colonel deferentially conveyed to his majesty the meaning of Balashov, whose family name he could not pronounce.::21/6/1914
Elk Grove::67333.02329410485::Dolokhov slowly straightened his bent leg and looked the general directly in the face with his light and insolent gaze.::11/11/1914
Lost Creek::978960.613178667::On all sides one saw wet, sad-faced officers, who seemed to be looking for something, and soldiers, who were dragging doors, benches, and fences from the village.::21/1/2010
Moxee City::775128.3641045226::Rostov staked five roubles and lost, staked once more and lost again. Dolokhov “killed”—that is, won—ten cards in a row from Rostov.::24/8/1922
Hockinson::722935.8743257564::“He’s better than all of you,” Natasha cried, getting up. “If you hadn’t interfered…Oh, my God, what is it, what is it! Why, Sonya! Go away!…” And she sobbed with that despair with which people weep only over a grief of which they feel themselves the cause. Marya Dmitrievna tried to speak again, but Natasha shouted: “Go away, go away, you all hate me and despise me!” and she threw herself onto the sofa again.::16/11/1830
Jackson::912527.5739073654::“What did they stop for? There’s no order!” said the soldiers. “What’s this shoving ahead? Devil take it! There’s such a thing as waiting. It’ll be worse if he  sets fire to the bridge. See, even the officer got shoved aside,” the halted crowds were saying on different sides, looking at each other, and still pressing forward towards the exit.::11/5/2012
Pembroke Pines::599924.237920132::The countess’s health still did not improve; but it was no longer possible to put off the trip to Moscow. A dowry had to be prepared, the house had to be sold, and, besides, Prince Andrei was first expected in Moscow, where Prince Nikolai Andreich was spending that winter, and Natasha was sure that he had already arrived.::18/5/1975
Mabana::397507.8813232679::“Take this and deliver it,” the minister of war said to his adjutant, handing him the papers and still paying no attention to the courier.::20/12/1995
Kangley::666480.6425857001::“Once again, Colonel,” the general said, “I cannot in any case leave half my men in the woods. I beg  you, I beg  you,” he repeated, “to take up your position  and prepare for the attack.”::1/12/1857
Clallam Bay::772691.6948268991::“It must be the work of Vinesse,”2 said Pierre, naming a famous miniaturist, leaning towards the table in order to take the snuffbox in his hands, and listening to the conversation at the other table.::1/12/1864
Salem::872436.1469018839::“If Bonaparte remains on the throne of France for another year,” the viscount continued the new conversation, with the air of a man who does not listen to others, but, in matters known better to him than to anyone else, follows only the train of his own thoughts, “things will go too far. Intrigues, coercion, banishments, executions will forever destroy French society—I mean good society—and then…”::2/4/1826
Enetai::658475.1577576153::“At least to put a fright into those little nuns. There are some Italian girls, young ones, they say. Really, I’d give five years of my life!”::20/3/1994
Clearview::666810.041665968::“How can they be displeased with anything,” thought Natasha. “Especially such a nice man as this Bezukhov?” In Natasha’s eyes, all who were at the ball were equally kind, nice, wonderful people, and loved each other: no one could offend anyone, and therefore they should all be happy.::16/9/1841
Sahalee::191882.0154437365::“I also keep arguing with your husband. I don’t understand why he wants to go to the war,” said Pierre, without any constraint (so usual in the relations of a young man with a young woman), turning to the princess.::23/6/1917
Springfield::71774.30103600335::“I just called on the countess, your spouse, and was so unlucky as to have my request go unfulfilled; I hope that with you, Count, I shall have more luck,” he said, smiling.::10/6/1976
Midway::761158.1349635215::On the eve of his departure from Petersburg, Prince Andrei brought along Pierre, who had not once been to the Rostovs’ since the time of the ball. Pierre looked perplexed and embarrassed. He was talking with the mother. Natasha sat down with Sonya by the chess table, thereby inviting Prince Andrei to join her. He went over to them.::14/4/1964
Corona::100976.33809768326::With the firm intention of settling his affairs in the regiment, resigning from the service, coming home and marrying Sonya, Nikolai, sad and serious, in discord with his family, but, as it seemed to him, passionately in love, left for his regiment at the beginning of January.::11/3/1863
Eugene::944686.6477764255::“How can a sovereign be undecided?” thought Rostov, and then even this indecision seemed majestic and enchanting to Rostov, like everything the sovereign did.::18/2/2008
Fort Collins::260983.84571388245::“She said…yes, she said: ‘Girl’ (to the femme de chambre ), ‘put on a livr&#233;e  and come with me, behind the carriage, faire des visites .’”*65::24/9/1898
Peoria::945072.510415226::Pierre, as one of the most honored guests, had to sit down to Boston with Ilya Andreevich, the general, and the colonel. At the Boston table, Pierre happened to sit facing Natasha, and he was struck by the odd change that had taken place in her since the day of the ball. Natasha was silent and not only was not as beautiful as she had been at the ball, but would even have been plain if she had not had such look of meekness and indifference to everything.::25/11/1964
Newport Hills::402605.99903352454::The whole day had been hot, there was a thunderstorm gathering somewhere, but only a small cloud had sent a sprinkle over the dust of the road and the juicy leaves. The left side of the woods was dark, in the shade; the right side, wet, glossy, sparkled in the sun, barely swayed by the wind. Everything was in flower; nightingales throbbed and trilled, now near, now far.::15/4/1899
Upper Preston::384305.6812481171::“She and Pyotr Ilyich are standing across from the Zharovo thicket,” Semyon replied, smiling. “She may be a lady, but she knows a lot about hunting.”::15/5/1887
Frisco::718686.4282688204::“And what the deuce makes us go to war with Bonaparte?” said Shinshin. “Il a d&#233;j&#224; rabattu le caquet &#224; l’Autriche. Je crains que cette fois ce ne soit notre tour.” *113::21/8/1860
Nordland::280610.57869886287::“You, my dear countess, are a notorious spendthrift,” said the count, and, kissing his wife’s hand, he went back to his study.::20/11/1854
Tyler::930543.1532244992::And some twenty men from various ranks ran to the front of the company. The drummer and lead singer turned to face the singers, waved his arm, and struck up a drawn-out soldiers’ song that began: “It was dawn, the sun was rising…” and ended with the words: “And that, brothers, will our glory be with old man Kamensky…” The song had been composed in Turkey, and was now being sung in Austria, only with one change, that instead of “old man Kamensky,” they put in “old man Kutuzov.”::1/8/1989
Camden::625029.2023248185::It was so bright that he could see the harness plates gleaming in the moonlight and the eyes of the horses glancing fearfully at their passengers, who were making a great noise under the dark roof of the porch.::5/12/1945
Rockport::786675.1978978055::Rostov, standing in the front ranks of Kutuzov’s army, which the sovereign rode up to first, had the same feeling that was experienced by every man in that army—a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud awareness of strength, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this solemnity.::17/1/1907
Cary::247229.77045104367::This letter had not yet been given to the sovereign when Barclay told Bolkonsky at dinner that the sovereign would like to see Prince Andrei in person, in order to question him about Turkey, and that Prince Andrei was to go to Bennigsen’s quarters at six o’clock in the evening.::17/10/1948
Preston::619078.9963049125::They fell silent. Prince Andrei looked closely into those mirror-like eyes which did not let anything in, and felt how ridiculous it was that he could have expected anything from Speransky and from all his activity connected with him, and that he could have ascribed importance to what Speransky was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter went on ringing in Prince Andrei’s ears long after he had left Speransky.::19/8/2009
Lancaster::195199.95662226842::But the smile did not embellish Vera’s face, as usually happens; on the contrary, her face became unnatural and therefore unpleasant. The elder one, Vera, was good-looking, far from stupid, an excellent student, well-brought-up, had a pleasant voice, and what she said was correct and appropriate; but, strangely, everyone, both the guest and the countess, turned to look at her, as if wondering why she had said it, and they felt awkward.::7/4/1880
Rochester::265803.3580874547::“Yes, yes, all right,” the count said quickly, “only, excuse me, my friend, I’ll give you twenty thousand, and a promissory note for eighty thousand besides. So there, kiss me.”::8/9/1970
Hayward::995471.3084958696::“Can it be that he’s my husband, precisely this stranger, this handsome, kind man—above all, kind,” thought Princess Marya, and fear, which hardly ever came to her, came over her now. She was afraid to look around; she fancied someone was standing there behind the screen, in the dark corner. And that someone was he—the devil—and he was this man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red mouth.::22/7/1898
Harbour Pointe::356304.23968258605::“Mais, mon prince,”  said Anna Mikhailovna, “give him a moment’s rest after such a great sacrament. Here, Pierre, tell us your opinion,” she turned to the young man who, coming up close to them, looked with astonishment at the princess’s spiteful face, which had lost all decency, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince Vassily.::10/6/2019
Wellpinit::780502.2448416089::“Natasha, it’s your turn now! Sing something for me,” said the countess’s voice. “Why are you sitting there like conspirators?”::2/11/1986
Glacier::873383.0252987356::“Dismiss an old man to his country estates, who is left disgraced as it is that he cannot fulfill the great and glorious destiny for which he was chosen. I shall await your most merciful permission here in the hospital, to avoid playing the role of a scrivener  rather than a commander  of troops. My removal from the army will cause no greater stir than if a blind man was leaving it. There are thousands like me in Russia.”::17/5/1804
Palmdale::430498.1131199025::And it suddenly became clear to Sonya that Natasha had some terrible plan for that night. Sonya knocked on her door. Natasha did not let her in.::5/5/1831
Eastsound::34316.37285532707::This was that initial period of a campaign when the troops still find themselves in good order, almost on the level of a peacetime review of maneuvers, only with a tinge of warlike showiness in their dress, and with a moral tinge of that gaiety and enthusiasm that always accompany the beginning of a campaign.::25/6/1971
Central Park::727679.6850564115::The princess pondered, smiled pensively (at which her face, lit up by her luminous eyes, was completely transformed) and, suddenly getting up, went with her heavy step to the desk. She took out some paper, and her hand quickly began moving across it. This is what she wrote in reply:::13/2/1872
Salinas::949003.7893114792::The regimental commander had so wanted to do that, he had been so sorry that he had had no time to do it, that it seemed to him that all this was exactly so. And perhaps it really was so? As if one could make out in that confusion what was and was not so?::20/11/1938
Alexandria::78549.21534042414::Prince Andrei had no time to answer him. The servants came out to meet them, and he asked them where the old prince was and how soon they expected him.::13/5/1893
Lakewood::372359.6407096188::“Well, come on then. I only stopped to ask Denisov about yesterday’s orders. Did you receive them, Denisov?”::23/12/1924
Lake Shore::604945.0233776164::“Give him a seat, give him a seat,” said Tushin. “You, uncle, spread a greatcoat under him,” he turned to his favorite soldier. “And where’s the wounded officer?”::7/6/1842
Houghton::805710.7810841603::“I have the pleasure of being acquainted, if the countess remembers me,” said Prince Andrei, with a courteous and low bow, totally contradicting Mme Peronsky’s remark about his rudeness, going up to Natasha and raising his arm to put it around her waist even before he finished asking her to dance. He suggested a turn of the waltz. That rapt expression of Natasha’s face, ready for despair and for ecstasy, suddenly lit up with a happy, grateful, childlike smile.::25/6/1971
Lake Cavanaugh::743422.1938237504::“And I remember being told that you were born under a cabbage,” Natasha said, “and I remember not daring to disbelieve it then, but I knew it wasn’t true, and I felt so awkward.”::24/4/1890
Springfield::469634.701080621::When the sovereign had ridden by almost all the regiments, the troops began a ceremonial march past him, and Rostov, on Bedouin, newly purchased from Denisov, rode at the tail end of his squadron—that is, alone and in full view of the sovereign.::22/6/1965
Mineral::777106.8404944206::“I thought today’s f&#234;te was cancelled. Je vous avoue que toutes ces f&#234;tes et tous ces feux d’artifice commencent &#224; devenir insipides. ”†6::7/8/1898
Lake Stickney::841795.7447624403::“Because he’s young, because he’s poor, because he’s a relation…because you don’t love him yourself.”::11/12/2010
Acme::537430.2363458812::He shrugged his shoulders. The servant led the young man down and up another stairway to Pyotr Kirillovich.::13/8/1966
Oyehut::844142.6816171517::“Oh! it’s terrible to feel myself so much in this man’s power,” thought Rostov. Rostov knew what a blow he would deal to his father, to his mother, in announcing this loss; he knew what happiness it would be to be delivered of it all, and he realized that Dolokhov knew he could deliver him from this shame and grief, but still wanted to play with him as a cat plays with a mouse.::18/4/1844
Pasadena::83866.46281805176::Before Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile appreciatively at these words of the viscount’s, Pierre again burst into the conversation, and Anna Pavlovna, though she anticipated that he would say something improper, could no longer stop him.::23/2/1808
Sunnyvale::202435.49638284708::“We’re philosophizing,” said Natasha, glancing at him for a moment, and continuing the conversation. The conversation had gone on to dreams.::20/3/1801
Fobes Hill::958926.7023204762::“Never mind, my dear count,” she said, closing her eyes meekly. “And I’ll go to Bezukhov’s myself,” she said. “Young Bezukhov has arrived, and we’ll now get everything from his conservatory. I have to see him anyway. He has sent me a letter from Boris. Thank God, Boris is with the staff now.”::22/6/2004
Rosario::858105.9345642505::“Anyhow, there’ll be a council of war at Kutuzov’s today: you can speak all this out there,” said Dolgorukov.::19/6/1995
Pomona::184205.39320964148::“I put down” (he spoke in French so that the Englishman would understand him, and he did not speak the language all that well), “I put down fifty imperials—want to make it a hundred?” he added, addressing the Englishman.::5/11/1829
Fox Island::834998.0584052491::“It’s all over, I’m lost!” he thought. “A bullet in the head is all that’s left to me,” and at the same time he said in a cheerful voice:::19/1/1903
Canyon Park::714980.513578485::After Russian dances and singing, Pelageya Danilovna joined all the servants and masters together in one big circle; they brought a ring, a piece of string, and a one-rouble coin, and played games together.::13/12/1836
Hollywood::507007.5643914071::On business to do with the trusteeship of the Ryazan estates, Prince Andrei had to see the provincial marshal of nobility. The marshal was Count Ilya Andreevich Rostov, and in the middle of May Prince Andrei went to see him.::24/12/1991
High Rock::145306.43589741478::Having ridden past some Austrian troops, Rostov noticed that the next part of the line (this was the guards) had already gone into action.::9/12/1899
Kansas City::691300.2424425212::The lieutenant was sitting in the second room of the tavern over a plate of sausage and a bottle of wine.::19/2/1868
Erlands Point::147338.2745843822::“Something very important is going on between them,” thought Pierre, and a joyful and at the same time bitter feeling stirred him and made him forget the game.::18/10/1863
Escondido::903746.0496249894::H&#233;l&#232;ne’s box was filled and surrounded on the parterre side by the most well-born and intelligent men, who seemed to vie with one another in their wish to show everyone that they were acquainted with her.::22/5/1831
Gorst::841849.8949633106::“Liberty and equality,” the viscount said scornfully, as if finally deciding to prove seriously to this young man all the stupidity of his talk, “these are resounding words that have long been compromised. Who doesn’t love liberty and equality? Our Savior already preached liberty and equality. Did people become happier after the revolution? On the contrary. We wanted liberty, but Bonaparte destroyed it.”::18/4/1991
Johnson::37781.72762384735::The story was very nice and interesting, especially the moment when the rivals suddenly recognized each other, and the ladies, it seemed, were stirred.::22/10/1840
Alderton::555841.4493410487::“What shtil,  how nicely he describes things!” she said, reading the descriptive part of the letter. “And what soul! Nothing about himself…nothing! About some Denisov, but he himself is probably braver than all of them. He writes nothing about his sufferings. And what heart! It’s so like him! And how he remembered everyone! He didn’t forget anybody. I always, always said, when he was only so high, I always said…”::19/6/1960
Dusty::169060.46975620382::A third of the guests had already arrived at the ball, but the Rostovs, who were to be there, were still hurriedly preparing to dress.::12/1/1885
Clarksville::255299.5928277161::The introduction to his speech was made, obviously, with the aim of bringing out the advantages of his position and showing that, in spite of that, he had accepted the opening of negotiations. But he now began to speak, and the more he spoke, the less able he was to control his speech.::19/6/1820
Bay Center::369146.88721332134::“No, quite the opposite—he had a cheerful face, and he turned to me,” and the moment she said it, she herself thought she had seen what she said.::14/8/1816
Joliet::162103.72596308799::When an apple ripens and falls—what makes it fall? Is it that it is attracted to the ground, is it that the stem withers, is it that the sun has dried it up, that it has grown heavier, that the wind shakes it, that the boy standing underneath wants to eat it?::22/4/1887
Mazama::886415.2439631413::“That one, I think, was Natasha,” thought Nikolai, “and that one Mme Schoss, or maybe not; and this Circassian with the mustache—I don’t know who she is, but I love her.”::19/7/1849
Selleck::599741.0476273326::Dolokhov dined frequently with the Rostovs, never missed a play when they went, and attended the balls for adolescentes *286 at Iogel’s, where the Rostovs always went. He paid most attention to Sonya and looked at her with such eyes that not only was she unable to endure that gaze without turning red, but even the old countess and Natasha blushed when they noticed it.::10/2/1923
Amanda Park::653830.7405204556::Despite the fact that in Moscow the Rostovs belonged to high society without knowing or thinking what society they belonged to, in Petersburg their society was mixed and indefinite. In Petersburg they were provincials to whom the very people that the Rostovs fed in Moscow without asking what society they belonged to would not lower themselves.::5/11/1850
Rockford::527860.3091047625::The uncle glanced disapprovingly at Petya and Natasha. He did not like combining play with the serious business of hunting.::12/10/1978
Sunnydale::890043.585107183::Behind the door, slippered footsteps were heard and shouts: “Spies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a moment’s peace in my own house!”::9/3/1995
Van Zandt::492936.1452094319::“Bon, je vous laisse dans votre petit coin. Je vois que vous y &#234;tes tr&#232;s bien,” *230 said the voice of Anna Pavlovna.::11/3/1988
McDonald::669391.1060951956::“But why these secrets? Why doesn’t he come to the house?” Sonya kept asking. “Why doesn’t he seek your hand directly? Prince Andrei gave you full freedom, if that’s how it is; but I don’t believe it. Natasha, have you thought what secret reasons  there might be?”::20/5/1996
Moclips::884761.1811824478::“Ah! Rostov! Greetings, greetings!” he shouted, in the same voice he used in the regiment; but Rostov noticed sadly that, behind this habitual casualness and liveliness, some new, bad, hidden feeling showed in the expression of Denisov’s face, in his intonations and words.::10/6/1830
Ocean Park::101520.68928718183::“Toujours charmante et m&#233;lancolique, cette ch&#232;re Julie,” ‡371 she said to the daughter. “Boris says his soul is eased in your house. He has suffered so many disappointments, and he is so sensitive,” she said to the mother.::4/9/1961
West Valley::376184.79016388685::“Ah, money, Count, money—there’s so much grief in the world because of it!” said the countess. “But I need this money very badly.”::9/11/1833
Thompson Place::510357.3840335863::Denisov was taken to the room prepared for him, and all the Rostovs gathered in the sitting room around Nikolushka.::9/8/1953
Dungeness::335697.66158705973::“Delighted, delighted,” he said and, looking her intently in the eye once again, quickly stepped away and sat down in his place. “Sit down, sit down! Mikhail Ivanovich, sit down.”::12/8/1801
Birch Bay::182887.40862690588::Saying this, the countess glanced at her daughter. Natasha lay looking straight ahead fixedly at one of the carved mahogany sphinxes at the corners of the bed, so that the countess could see her daughter’s face only in profile. This face struck the countess by its especially serious and concentrated expression.::15/6/1991
Stratford::935020.8722320943::Rostov did not think of what the call for a stretcher meant; he ran on, trying only to be ahead of everyone else; but just by the bridge, not looking under his feet, he got into the slimy, trampled mud, stumbled, and fell on his hands. Others ran past him.::12/8/1899
Torrance::440513.2529419894::“Wine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Hot temper? Anger? Women?” he went through his vices, weighing them mentally, and did not know which to give preference to.::4/6/1957
Naperville::262029.45501084262::Sometime past nine a break, a droshky, and three mounted men came looking for Natasha and Petya. The count and countess did not know where they were and were very worried, as the messenger said.::20/9/1931
Barberton::168722.28625179108::“O-one! Two! Three!…” Denisov cried out angrily and stepped aside. The two men began walking over the imprinted tracks, getting closer and closer, and recognizing each other in the fog. The adversaries had the right to fire at any time while coming to the barrier. Dolokhov walked slowly, without raising his pistol, his light, shining blue eyes peering into his adversary’s face. On his mouth there was, as usual, the semblance of a smile.::25/12/1939
Paterson::737755.8011912643::“C’est que je d&#233;teste les histoires des revenants,” ‡41 said Prince Ippolit in such a tone that it was clear he had said these words and only then understood what they meant.::18/3/1940
Savannah::841679.973489209::“I also wanted to ask you,” Prince Andrei continued, “if I’m killed, and if I should have a son, don’t let him leave you, as I told you yesterday; he should grow up here with you…please.”::19/6/1890
Almota::95263.79345833813::“I must, I must have a talk with you,” said Prince Andrei. “You know those women’s gloves” (he meant the Masonic gloves which were given to a newly initiated brother to be presented to a beloved woman). “I…But no, I’ll talk with you later…” And Prince Andrei, with a strange gleam in his eyes and with uneasy movements, went over to Natasha and sat down beside her. Pierre saw how Prince Andrei asked her something, and she, blushing, answered him.::2/5/1980
Skamokawa::437011.5727881317::“How beautiful! She yields nothing to Marya Antonovna.17 See how the men dangle after her, young and old. Both beautiful and intelligent. They say Prince——has lost his mind over her. But these two here, though they’re not beautiful, are still more surrounded.”::15/11/1981
Bridgeport::916651.1408335107::“If you are firm, then I must commence your induction,” said the rhetor, coming closer to Pierre. “As a sign of generosity, I ask you to give me all your valuables.”::16/9/1821

Bay View::698516.7015946736::“Ah!” said Kutuzov. “I hope this lesson will set you straight. Serve well. Our sovereign is merciful. And I won’t forget you, if you prove worthy.”::18/5/1965
Newaukum::865165.3338170272::Those who were in the dimly lit room talked together in broken whispers, and fell silent each time, turning with eyes full of inquiry and expectation to the door which led to the dying man’s room and which made a faint noise whenever someone went in or came out.::24/8/1986
Meadow Glade::885393.0673771132::The company commander, not taking his eyes off his superior officer, pressed his two fingers more and more firmly to his visor, as if he now saw salvation only in this pressing.::3/2/1881
Disautel::63313.54078651497::The meeting was over, and on his return home it seemed to Pierre that he had come back from some distant journey, where he had spent dozens of years, had changed completely, and had detached himself from the former order and habits of his life.::7/12/1864
Copalis Crossing::745655.710353674::They fell silent. Prince Andrei looked closely into those mirror-like eyes which did not let anything in, and felt how ridiculous it was that he could have expected anything from Speransky and from all his activity connected with him, and that he could have ascribed importance to what Speransky was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter went on ringing in Prince Andrei’s ears long after he had left Speransky.::14/4/1810
Burley::24693.675099379252::“Well, now,” said his father, who was in an especially cheerful mood. “I told you it wouldn’t be enough. How much?”::17/1/1990
Mesquite::749764.8108555624::The next day, having taken leave of the count alone, without waiting for the ladies to come out, Prince Andrei drove home.::23/8/1845
Killeen::639012.7729750073::“Add two more notches and it’ll be just right,” he shouted in a high-pitched voice, trying to give it a dashing sound, which did not go with his little figure. “Number two,” he squeaked. “Smash ’em, Medvedev!”::22/7/1941
Bethel::954111.5574059577::“That’s doubtful,” said Prince Andrei. “Monsieur le vicomte  quite rightly supposes that things have already gone too far. I think it would be hard to return to the old ways.”::15/11/1908
South Hill::938309.2007664795::Prince Nikolai Andreevich sat in his usual place at the end of the sofa, moved a chair for Prince Vassily towards him, pointed to it, and began asking questions about political matters and the latest news. He listened as if with attention to Prince Vassily’s account, but kept glancing at Princess Marya.::22/5/1876
Baring::47969.98621403492::“Well, now,” said his father, who was in an especially cheerful mood. “I told you it wouldn’t be enough. How much?”::2/5/1814

Leadpoint::754934.944325998::After dinner he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little princess was sitting at a small table chatting with the maid Masha. She turned pale when she saw her father-in-law.::22/3/2017
Brooklyn::156745.904524474::When Boris came in, Pierre was pacing his room, stopping now and then in the corners, making threatening gestures to the wall, as if piercing the invisible enemy with a sword, and looking sternly over his spectacles, and then starting his promenade again, uttering vague words, shrugging his shoulders, and spreading his arms.::11/1/1862
Syracuse::916628.4323508012::Rostov fearfully began to justify himself, but seeing the general’s good-naturedly joking face, led him aside and in an agitated voice told him the whole affair, begging the general to intercede for Denisov, whom he knew. The general listened to Rostov, shaking his head gravely.::8/2/1966
Esperance::84259.47077553319::“Well, Sonya,” she said, and went out to the very middle of the reception room, where, in her opinion, the resonance was best. Raising her head, lowering her lifelessly hanging arms as dancers do, Natasha made a few energetic steps from heel to toe in the middle of the room and stopped.::25/8/1975
McAllen::293590.9688680637::“Mama! what’s for dessert?” cried Natasha, boldly now and with capricious merriment, certain beforehand that her escapade would be taken well.::3/5/2013
Pasadena::381648.640319733::“In the beginning I didn’t like it much, because what is it that makes a city pleasant? Ce sont les jolies femmes, *376 isn’t that so? Well, but now I like it very much,” he said, looking at her meaningfully. “Will you come to this carousel, Countess? Please do come,” he said and, reaching his hand out to her bouquet and lowering his voice, he said: “Vous serez la plus jolie. Venez, ch&#232;re comtesse, et comme gage donnez-moi cette fleur.” †377::10/11/1812

Bellevue::896295.3791230668::While performing the figures of the mazurka, Boris was ceaselessly tormented by the thought of the news brought by Balashov and how to find it out before anyone else.::21/2/1867
Littlerock::360274.6072338925::Pierre walked along, rolling his fat body, parting the crowd, nodding to right and left as casually and good-naturedly as if he was walking through a marketplace crowd. He moved through the crowd, evidently searching for someone.::2/5/1847
Trentwood::443657.4758968529::In October 1805 Russian troops were occupying villages and towns in the archduchy of Austria, and more new regiments kept arriving from Russia to be stationed by the fortress of Braunau, burdening the local inhabitants with their billeting.

Klickitat::399500.2387130995::“There was one, there was one like that,” the doctor said as if joyfully. “Must have died, but anyhow I’ll check, I had lists. Do you have them, Makeev?”::13/1/1925

San de Fuca::842826.5307919735::When an apple ripens and falls—what makes it fall? Is it that it is attracted to the ground, is it that the stem withers, is it that the sun has dried it up, that it has grown heavier, that the wind shakes it, that the boy standing underneath wants to eat it?::5/10/1839
Dayton::340092.71558537433::Late that night, when everyone had dispersed, Denisov, with his short hand, patted his favorite, Rostov, on the shoulder.::22/7/1816
Richardson::353400.2282777362::“Stop them!” he cried, and at the same time, probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right.::1/12/1913
Miramar::379500.30298356886::“What can I tell you?” said the prince, in a cold, bored tone. “Qu’a-t-on d&#233;cid&#233;? On a d&#233;cid&#233; que Buonaparte a br&#251;l&#233; ses vaisseaux, et je crois que nous sommes en train de br&#251;ler les n&#244;tres. ”§8::17/9/1850
Thornton::321293.3232768738::“A future life?” Prince Andrei repeated, but Pierre gave him no time to reply, and took this repetition for a denial, the more so as he knew Prince Andrei’s former atheistic convictions.::21/5/1999
Cliffdell::209741.61526581913::Having reached the troops of the left flank, he did not ride forward, where the shooting was, but went looking for the general and the officers where they could not be, and therefore did not deliver the order.::10/4/1926
Fall City::820548.8846818403::“All the same, seriously speaking,” replied Prince Andrei, “we can still say without boasting that this is a bit better than Ulm…”::23/3/1908
Dockton::493029.42847283505::“I shall never dare to say that I know the truth,” said the Mason, amazing Pierre more and more with his definite and firm speech. “No one can attain to the truth by himself; only stone by stone, with the participation of all, over millions of generations, from our forefather Adam down to our time, is the temple being built which is to become a worthy dwelling place for the great God,” said the Mason, and he closed his eyes.::25/3/1916
Conway::20204.198300267763::“La r&#233;serve, sire!”  someone’s voice replied, so human after the non-human voice that had said: “Les hussards de Pavlograd?”::10/10/1839
Marshall::347966.69317303365::Bolkonsky made use of this time to go to Dolgorukov and find out the details of the action. Prince Andrei sensed that Kutuzov was upset and displeased about something, and that there was displeasure with him at headquarters, and that all the persons of the imperial headquarters used with him the tone of people who knew something that others did not, and therefore he wanted to talk with Dolgorukov.::12/11/1897
West Valley City::928482.8953103705::“Wait, listen. That’s really clever!” replied Sidorov, who was considered an expert at speaking French.::4/4/2012
Canterwood::205501.66570428485::She became embarrassed, looked around, and, seeing her doll abandoned on a tub, took it in her hands.::4/9/2016
Lexington::90792.18286520685::“But nothing, nothing like this…has ever happened to me before!” she said. “Only I’m frightened, I’m always frightened with him—what does it mean? It means it’s something real, doesn’t it? Mama, are you asleep?”::22/11/1967
Country Homes::278484.43660436175::“My cousin has nothing to do with it, and there is no point in talking about her!” he cried in a rage.::23/6/1866
Altoona::159949.85420996288::The brisk song gave a special meaning to the tone of casual merriment with which Zherkov spoke, and to the intentional coldness of Dolokhov’s replies.::24/4/1821
Olathe::292159.33669836394::“One shy of a million,” a merry soldier in a torn greatcoat, passing close by, said with a wink and vanished; after him came another old soldier.::23/10/1833
Waldron::746759.0204155282::“Supper, time for supper! The Gypsies are here!” Indeed, some dark-haired men and women, saying something with a Gypsy accent, were already coming in from the cold. Nikolai knew it was all over, but he said in an indifferent voice:::23/1/1846
Chesaw::795936.827272739::“Pyotr Kirilyich,” she began, speaking quickly, “Prince Bolkonsky was your friend—is your friend,” she corrected herself (it seemed to her that everything only was and that now it was all different). “He told me then to turn to you…”::8/9/1916
Sunnyslope::857906.1979859802::Prince Andrei looked at Tushin and, saying nothing, walked away. Prince Andrei felt sad and downhearted. All this was so strange, so unlike what he had hoped for.::6/7/1816
Olympic View::112977.89972309646::“What do I care about your allies?” said Napoleon. “I have the Poles for allies: there are eighty thousand of them, they fight like lions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them.”::5/9/1971
Hood::504358.43540316017::“I’ll go anywhere the countess orders me to!” said Denisov, who had jokingly placed himself on the footing of Natasha’s knight in the Rostovs’ house. “I’m ready to dance the pas de ch&#226;le. ”*287::14/10/1848
Elbe::831404.1350393142::“Ah, he’s in a terrible state,” the mother said to the son, as they were getting back into the carriage. “He hardly recognizes anyone.”::1/12/1856
Venice::533011.8798952843::“But no one has, so what do you want? It’s a circulus viciosus  which we must make an effort to break out of.”::13/2/1862
Cumberland::642254.0094511552::Napoleon met Balashov with a cheerful and benign air. Not only was there no expression in him of embarrassment or self-reproach for his morning’s outburst, but, on the contrary, he tried to encourage Balashov. Clearly it was Napoleon’s long-standing conviction that the possibility of mistakes did not exist for him, and to his mind everything he did was good, not because it agreed with any notion of what was good and bad, but because he  did it.::13/3/1840
Ostrander::631972.3935574819::“Where is it, that lofty sky, which I never knew till now and saw today?” was his first thought. “And I never knew this suffering either,” he thought. “Yes, I knew nothing, nothing till now. But where am I?”::5/9/1808
Cohassett Beach::712353.0058110143::All the faces in the sovereign’s suite instantly exchanged glances with each other, expressing murmur and reproach. “Old as he may be, he should not, he simply should not speak that way,” these faces expressed.::7/7/1948
Deming::208082.78676006998::“Will you go to Iogel’s, Nikolenka? Please do,” Natasha said to him, “he has asked you specially, and Vassily Dmitrich (that is, Denisov) is going.”::20/1/1889
Sekiu::476007.64921116346::“I don’t think so,” he said, “although—yes. She doesn’t deign to be intelligent…Ah, no, she’s enchanting, that’s all.”::9/11/1884
Terrace Heights::175940.10128612947::Nesvitsky turned and saw, fifteen paces away, separated from him by the living mass of moving infantry, red, black, disheveled, his peaked cap pushed back, his dolman thrown dashingly over his shoulder—Vaska Denisov.::11/5/1861
Nemah::588469.832307585::“That’s all rubbish,” Prince Andrei stopped him again, “better let’s talk about business. Have you been to the horse guards?…”::11/1/1894
Neilton::434525.93563201017::Only now, at the sight of his dread superiors, did Tushin realize in all its horror his guilt and disgrace at having remained alive while losing two guns. He had been so agitated that until that moment he had not managed to think of it. The laughter of the officers threw him off still more. He stood before Bagration with a trembling lower jaw and was barely able to say:::23/1/2005
Grays River::681933.2528335679::“Mais c’est un palais,”  she said to her husband, looking around with the expression of someone paying compliments to the host at a ball. “Allons, vite, vite!…” *154 Looking about, she smiled at Tikhon, and at her husband, and at the servant who accompanied them.::22/6/1816
Ashford::686477.4548328093::“Good-bye, dear heart,” said Tushin, “you good soul! Good-bye, dear heart,” Tushin said with tears, which for some reason suddenly came to his eyes.::22/12/1815
Boistfort::422615.85340640415::Boris felt that Pierre did not recognize him, but he did not consider it necessary to give his name, and, not feeling the least embarrassed, looked him straight in the eye.::17/4/1876
Hampton::243180.7355691561::“I? I? What was I telling you?” Pierre said suddenly, getting up and beginning to pace the room. “I’ve always thought so…This girl is such a treasure, such a…She’s a rare girl…My dear friend, I beg you, don’t be clever, don’t doubt, marry, marry, marry…And I’m sure there’ll be no man happier than you.”::17/1/1863
Warren::150690.95542592692::Willarski was silent the whole way. To Pierre’s question of what he must do and how to answer, Willarski said only that brothers more worthy than he would test him and that Pierre need do nothing more than tell the truth.::12/11/1850
South Broadway::381896.43165258644::Pierre started drinking glass after glass, looking from under his brows at the drunken guests, who again crowded by the window, and listening to their talk. Anatole poured the wine for him and told him that Dolokhov was making a bet with the Englishman Stevens, a sailor who was there, that he, Dolokhov, could drink a bottle of rum sitting in the third-floor window with his legs hanging out.::11/11/1938
Edwall::249026.74076273324::Rostov had become a bluff, good-natured fellow, whom his Moscow acquaintances would have found slightly mauvais genre, *354 but who was loved and respected by his comrades, subordinates, and superiors, and who was content with his life. Lately—that is, in 1809—in letters from home, he often found complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling into worse and worse disorder, and that it was time for him to come home, to bring joy and peace to his old parents.::9/8/1902
Georgetown::644259.7758636781::“Yes, yes, all right,” the count said quickly, “only, excuse me, my friend, I’ll give you twenty thousand, and a promissory note for eighty thousand besides. So there, kiss me.”::16/10/1914
Maryhill::994370.1966966379::He paced silently from one corner of the room to the other, and again stopped in front of Balashov. His face was as if petrified in its stern expression, and his left leg trembled still more rapidly than before. Napoleon knew that he had this trembling of the left calf. “La vibration de mon mollet gauche est un grand signe chez moi,” *406 he would say later.::22/4/1828
Huntsville::995061.2956089822::Outside there was the same immobile cold, the same moon, only it was still brighter. The light was so strong and there were so many stars on the snow, that one did not want to look at the sky, and the real stars went unnoticed. The sky was black and dull, the earth was merry.::15/3/1951
Greenbank::43850.49146857134::Now it was not, as before, an invisible river flowing in the darkness, but like a gloomy sea subsiding and quivering after a storm. Rostov mindlessly watched and listened to what was happening before him and around him. An infantryman came up to the fire, squatted down, put his hands to the fire, and turned his face away.::22/3/1814
Murphys Corner::271575.39119247464::“A seasoned one?” asked Ilagin, approaching the hunter who had spotted the hare and turning, not without excitement, to whistle up Yerza…::6/10/1861

Felida::141674.08664825663::After M&#233;tivier’s departure, the old prince called his daughter to him, and all the force of his wrath fell upon her. It was her fault that a spy had been let in to his rooms. Yet he had told her, he had told her to make a list and not let in anyone not on the list. Why had this scoundrel been let in? She was the cause of it all. “With her he could not have a moment’s peace, he could not die in peace,” he said.::21/12/1976
Fairview::124363.26897086824::The happy state of mind of the officers after the review passed itself on to the soldiers. The company walked along merrily. On all sides soldiers’ voices exchanged remarks.::25/12/1804

Waco::614823.9831743392::“Yes, yes,” he said, “it’s hard, I’m afraid it’s hard to find…it happens! Yes, it happens to everybody…” And, giving his son a fleeting look, the count started out of the room…Nikolai had been prepared for a rebuff, but he had never expected this…::8/5/1940

Seattle Heights::995729.0822367597::In the course of their long conversation on Wednesday evening, Speransky said more than once: “Among us  everything that lies outside the general level of inveterate habit is considered…” or, with a smile: “But we  want the wolves well-fed and the sheep safe…” or: “They  cannot understand it…” And all that with an expression which said: “We, you and I, understand what they  are and who we  are.”::17/4/2014
Strandell::153083.73245819472::There was a thaw, mud, cold, the ice on the river broke up, the roads became impassable; for several days provisions had not been issued either to the horses or to the men.

Key Center::292629.11367536325::“You think so?…” said Anna Pavlovna, in order to say something, and again turned to her duties as mistress of the house, but Pierre committed the reverse discourtesy. Earlier he had walked away without hearing out a lady who was talking to him; now he held with his conversation a lady who needed to leave him. Lowering his head and spreading his big feet, he began to explain to Anna Pavlovna why he thought that the abb&#233;’s plan was a chimera.::25/6/1824
Grand Mound::679285.3127936365::“Kindly let this wagon pass. Don’t you see it’s a woman?” said Prince Andrei, riding up to the officer.::19/2/1856
Taholah::470287.24507231003::“Slightly wounded, but promoted to officer; he’s recovered now, he wrote himself,” she said through her tears.::19/8/1891
Port Blakely::483944.99986993::“Mama, Bolkonsky’s here!” she said. “Mama, it’s terrible, it’s unbearable! I don’t want…to suffer! What am I to do?…”::3/5/1976
Malone::616994.7554370263::On the twelfth of November, Kutuzov’s active army, camped near Olm&#252;tz, was preparing to be reviewed the next day by two emperors—Russian and Austrian. The guards, just arrived from Russia, were spending the night some ten miles from Olm&#252;tz, and the next day would come straight to the review, entering the field at Olm&#252;tz by ten o’clock in the morning.::7/11/2009
Boston Harbor::86189.76455149896::“Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip,” he went on. “Everyone’s concerned about whom the count will leave his fortune to, though maybe he’ll outlive us all, which is my heartfelt wish…”::25/4/1981
Carrollton::13625.07904284238::“Don’t talk to me about that. What do I care?” he said. “I say that I’m madly, madly in love with you. Is it my fault that you’re exquisite?…It’s our turn.”::17/6/1838
Menlo::97242.38587792745::The squadron crossed the bridge and moved out of the range of fire without losing a single man. After them the second squadron, forming a line, also crossed, and the last Cossacks cleared off from that side.::14/10/1937

Glendale::612001.1597728617::“Yes. Vous savez entre cousin et cousine cette intimit&#233; m&#232;ne quelquefois &#224; l’amour: le cousinage est un dangereux voisinage. N’est-ce pas? ”*352::11/1/1899
Surprise::10254.709506576142::“Well, come on then. I only stopped to ask Denisov about yesterday’s orders. Did you receive them, Denisov?”::7/1/2014
Sawyer::305909.1785892303::The next day Davout left early in the morning and, summoning Balashov, told him imposingly that he asked him to remain there, to move along with the baggage, if such were the orders, and to speak with no one except M. de Castries.::20/9/1855
Roseville::134393.38424500992::“A petition—go to the officer on duty, this way, please” (he pointed him to the downstairs door). “Only you won’t be received.”::14/3/1839

Murfreesboro::995033.4562124442::Returning from leave this time, Rostov felt and realized for the first time how strong his bond was with Denisov and the whole regiment.::13/10/1881
Carlisle::87562.675748444::Across from Nikolai was a field of winter wheat, and there stood one of his hunters, alone, in a hollow behind an upthrust hazel bush. As soon as the hounds were loosed into the ravine, Nikolai heard the intermittent baying of a dog he knew—Voltorn; other dogs joined him, now falling silent, now giving tongue again. A moment later from the woods came a foxhunting cry, and the whole pack, joining together, went racing along the edge of the ravine in the direction of the field, away from Nikolai.::1/2/1804
Gainesville::911669.7902442641::“Sire, je vous demande la permission de donner la L&#233;gion d’honneur au plus brave de vos soldats,” *333 said a sharp, precise voice, articulating every letter.::10/1/1989

Visalia::488074.0065538438::Each dog knew its master and its name. Each hunter knew his task, place, and purpose. As soon as they went beyond the fence, everybody, with no noise or talk, spread out evenly and calmly along the road and field leading to the Otradnoe woods.::13/3/1932
Parkland::113903.58444311244::“First of all, Trunila’s not a dog, he’s a bloodhound,” thought Nikolai, and he glanced sternly at his sister, trying to make her feel the distance that should separate them at that moment. Natasha understood it.::8/8/1892
Veradale::474681.58233811083::When the officers drank up and smashed their glasses, Kirsten filled others, and, in nothing but his shirt and breeches, with the glass in his hand, went up to the soldiers’ campfires, struck a majestic pose, with his long gray mustache, his white chest showing through his unbuttoned shirt, stood in the firelight, and swung his arm up.::7/10/1924
Kummer::20892.473516144648::“You’ll never understand it,” she said, turning to Vera, “because you’ve never loved anybody, you have no heart, you’re just a Madame de Genlis” (this nickname, considered very offensive, had been given to Vera by Nikolai), “and your highest pleasure is to do unpleasant things to others.

Boyds::259678.43265607193::“How she loves me!” thought Princess Marya. “How happy I am now, and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Can it be—a husband?” she thought, not daring to look up at his face, still feeling that same gaze directed at her.::18/2/1933
Stamford::725869.954063783::“Yes, of course it’s right,” said Anatole, who obviously was not listening to Dolokhov, and, with a smile that never left his face, he looked straight ahead.::19/2/1842

Larimers Corner::418336.9265403719::Neither her father and mother, nor Sonya, nor Prince Andrei himself could have foreseen how parting with her fianc&#233; would affect Natasha. Flushed and agitated, her eyes dry, she wandered about the house that day, occupying herself with the most insignificant things, as if not understanding what awaited her.

Concord::742672.715467::“I won’t sleep anyway. How stupid it is to sleep! Mama, mama, nothing like this has ever happened to me!” she repeated with astonishment and fear before the feeling she was aware of within her. “Who could have thought!…”::16/7/1954

Lafayette::255730.2712407704::Trying to offend Weyrother as stingingly as he could in his amour propre as a military author, Langeron demonstrated that Bonaparte could easily attack, instead of being attacked, and thereby make this disposition totally useless. Weyrother responded to all his objections with a firm, contemptuous smile, obviously prepared beforehand for every objection, regardless of what might be said to him.::1/9/1993
Custer::90131.314098301::Pierre did not have the practical tenacity that would have given him the possibility of undertaking the business directly, and therefore he did not like it, and only tried to pretend to the steward that he was occupied with it. And the steward tried to pretend to the count that he considered this occupation quite useful for the master and inconvenient for himself.::6/12/1917
Orcas::371758.09169673425::“Let me…be…what do I…I’ll…die…” she said, freed herself from Marya Dmitrievna with an angry thrust, and lay in her former position.::20/9/1851
Diablo::881383.7084288392::“Since last evening my fate is sealed: to be loved by you or to die. I have no other way out,” the letter began. Then he wrote that he knew the family would not give her to him, that there were secret reasons for that which he could reveal only to her, but that if she loved him, she had only to say the word “yes” and no human powers would prevent their bliss. Love would overcome all. He would abduct her and carry her off to the ends of the earth.::15/10/1925
Christopher::36073.84295927441::“It would be nice to go to Kuragin’s,” he thought. But at once he remembered the word of honor he had given Prince Andrei not to visit Kuragin.::17/4/1837
Midvale Corner::765993.5010253835::Before Rostov had time to think and determine how far away those shots were, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy’s adjutant came galloping from Vitebsk with orders to proceed down the road at a trot.::13/5/1863
Kent::396502.5534982185::Rostov was especially struck by the beauty of a small, purebred, red-spotted bitch in Ilagin’s pack, slender, but with muscles of steel, narrow pincers (muzzle), and prominent black eyes. He had heard about the swiftness of Ilagin’s dogs and in this beautiful bitch saw a rival to his Milka.::1/9/2016
Topeka::172464.77180024778::As over a plush carpet, the horses walked over the field, splashing in puddles now and then as they crossed the roads. The misty sky went on imperceptibly and evenly descending to earth; the air was still, warm, soundless. Now and then came the whistle of a hunter, the snort of a horse, the crack of a whip, or the squeal of a hound strayed from its place.::7/3/1936
Simi Valley::222869.6599566351::“In my view,” he said, turning to Rostov, “he ought simply to beg the sovereign for mercy. They say there will be lots of rewards now, and surely he’d be forgiven…”::10/2/1811
Three Lakes::350489.84443795815::“His majesty drew his attention to the grenadier division and the ceremonial march past,” the general went on, “and the ambassador supposedly paid no attention to it and supposedly allowed himself to say that ‘we in France pay no attention to such trifles.’ The sovereign did not deign to reply. At the next review, they say, the sovereign did not deign to address him even once.”::9/10/1967
Kendall::168960.26110716266::“How she loves me!” thought Princess Marya. “How happy I am now, and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Can it be—a husband?” she thought, not daring to look up at his face, still feeling that same gaze directed at her.::20/9/1833
Kanaskat::804897.2916991857::“No, I was only surprised that you’ve left the regiment. Dans un moment je suis &#224; vous, ”*329 he replied to a voice that was calling him.::15/9/1905
Santa Clara::411503.67508521635::Just then Anna Mikhailovna stepped inaudibly into the room, with the business-like, preoccupied, and at the same time meek Christian look that never left her. Though Anna Mikhailovna found the count in his dressing gown every day, he became embarrassed each time and apologized for his costume. He did so now as well.::24/4/1944
Athens::746006.1137093748::Dolokhov remained by the gate. Anatole followed the maid into the yard, turned the corner, and ran up to the porch.::10/3/1984
Nile::927017.8690921083::“Mama, the toque more to one side,” said Natasha. “I’ll re-pin it,” and she rushed forward, and the sewing girls, who had no time to follow her, tore off a piece of gauze.::9/9/1857
Alderwood Manor::308214.0470770817::“Natalya Ilyinichna,” Pierre began, lowering his eyes and feeling pity for her and loathing for the operation he had to perform, “it should make no difference to you whether it’s true or not, because…”::19/7/1936
Clarkston Heights::154462.0021473485::“And what secrets can there be at your age between Natasha and Boris and between you two? It’s all silliness!”::11/12/1893

Victorville::167503.5161790983::At that same time, Andrei was sitting with Pierre and telling him of his love for Natasha and of his firm intention to marry her.::6/1/1862
Abilene::953007.8330533215::“Only when will it all be? Never, I’m afraid…It would be too good!” said Natasha, getting up and going over to the mirrors.::7/1/1821
Chimacum::612002.4258880022::Nikolai had never seen Ilagin, but, as usual, knowing no middle way in his opinions and feelings, judging by the rumors of this landowner’s violence and willfulness, hated him with all his heart and considered him his bitterest enemy. He was now riding to him in angry agitation, firmly gripping his whip and fully prepared for the most resolute and dangerous actions against his enemy.::20/8/1891
Naselle::549823.9051331304::Pierre, arriving first, went to Prince Andrei’s study, being a familiar of the house, and, as was his habit, at once lay down on the sofa, took the first book that caught his eye from the shelf (it was Caesar’s Commentaries ),21 and, leaning on his elbow, began reading it from the middle.::2/8/1943
Grotto::246507.96722453527::The soldier at whom the laughing men were pointing was Dolokhov. Prince Andrei recognized him and listened to what he was saying. Dolokhov and his company commander had come to the line from the left flank, where their regiment was stationed.::15/11/1962
Norman::967439.899488154::When Princess Marya came into his study at the usual time, he was standing and working at his lathe, but, as usual, did not turn to her.::25/2/1890
Vallejo::631484.7775923993::Boris came to the Rostovs’ box, received their felicitations with great simplicity and, raising his eyebrows, with a distracted smile, conveyed to Natasha and Sonya his fianc&#233;e’s request that they be present at her wedding, and left. Natasha spoke to him with a merry and flirtatious smile, and offered to that same Boris with whom she had once been in love her felicitations on his marriage. In the state of inebriation she was in, everything seemed simple and natural.::1/5/1933
Pine City::217602.0156159315::“Very glad to see you. Go in where they’ve assembled, and wait for me.” The sovereign went to the study. He was followed by Prince Pyotr Mikhailovich Volkonsky and Baron Stein, and the doors closed behind them. Prince Andrei, taking advantage of the sovereign’s permission, went, along with Paulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, into the drawing room where the council was assembled.::6/2/1860
Berkeley::432848.16462929174::“Sell me the little lady,” another soldier said, with a stress on the last syllable, addressing the German, who, lowering his eyes, walked on with big strides, angry and frightened.::7/7/1998
Round Rock::362981.2969116657::Trying to offend Weyrother as stingingly as he could in his amour propre as a military author, Langeron demonstrated that Bonaparte could easily attack, instead of being attacked, and thereby make this disposition totally useless. Weyrother responded to all his objections with a firm, contemptuous smile, obviously prepared beforehand for every objection, regardless of what might be said to him.::12/12/1850
Ann Arbor::797788.77982567::“Well, you haven’t told me anything new.” And the old man muttered pensively to himself in a quick patter: “Dieu sait quand reviendra.  Go to the dining room.”::4/10/1919
Fargo::931322.0957742406::On all sides there were loving eyes, glistening with tears of joy, there were lips that wanted to kiss him.::6/10/1973
Belmont::90013.07881281317::Prince Vassily looked questioningly at the princess, but could not tell whether she was considering what he had said to her, or was simply staring at him…::9/5/1958
Columbia::507777.9647282182::This was that initial period of a campaign when the troops still find themselves in good order, almost on the level of a peacetime review of maneuvers, only with a tinge of warlike showiness in their dress, and with a moral tinge of that gaiety and enthusiasm that always accompany the beginning of a campaign.::22/9/2000
Allentown::274912.3558707097::“It’s not my fault that the conversation started in front of other officers. Maybe I shouldn’t have spoken in front of them, but I’m no diplomat. I joined the hussars because I thought there was no need for subtleties here, but he calls me a liar…so let him give me satisfaction…”::15/11/1825
Seabeck::525319.4418328373::“How clear it is, Nicolas!” Sonya’s voice said. Nikolai turned to look at Sonya and bent down to see her face more closely. A totally new, dear face with black eyebrows and mustache, both near and distant in the moonlight, peeked from the sable fur.::23/12/1853
Evansville::527019.6164280688::“Ah, why do such people as you have children? If you weren’t a father, I’d have nothing to reproach you for,” said Anna Pavlovna, raising her eyes pensively.::4/12/1844
Beaumont::1023.7637953153245::“Pourquoi? Je vous aime plus que jamais,”  said Princess Marya, “et je t&#226;cherai de faire tout ce qui est en mon pouvoir pour votre bonheur.” †253::21/3/1801
Otis Orchards::902131.3692985966::After these words, the Mason, as if tired after talking for so long, again leaned back on the sofa and closed his eyes.

Odessa::448946.1949556807::“Tomorrow our squadron is assigned to the reserves. Allow me to request that you attach me to the first squadron.”::2/9/1856
West Pasco::451664.27970584924::Having come home and told their mother how they spent the time at the Melyukovs’, the girls went to their room. They undressed, but without wiping off their cork mustaches, and sat for a long time talking about their happiness. They talked about how they would live when they were married, how their husbands would be friends, and how they would be happy. Mirrors prepared by Dunyasha since evening stood on Natasha’s table.::5/10/1815
Badger::358633.35973580426::“Well, now for a declamation!” said Speransky, coming out of his study. “An astonishing talent!” he said to Prince Andrei. Magnitsky at once assumed a pose and began to recite humorous verses he had composed in French about certain persons well-known in Petersburg, and was interrupted several times by applause. When the verses were over, Prince Andrei went up to Speransky to take his leave.::14/12/1844
Wilmington::919255.9319219294::“Not yet, ” Napoleon put in, and, as if afraid of giving way to his emotion, he frowned and inclined his head slightly, thereby letting Balashov feel that he could go on.::2/4/1993
Ravensdale::646483.729295314::Kutuzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes flashed over his face as when he had turned away from Captain Timokhin. He turned away and winced, as if wishing to express thereby that all that Dolokhov had said to him and all that he could say had long, long been known to him, that it all bored him, and that it was all by no means what was needed. He turned away and made for the coach.::12/9/1951
Rollingbay::724859.9277010644::“But why these secrets? Why doesn’t he come to the house?” Sonya kept asking. “Why doesn’t he seek your hand directly? Prince Andrei gave you full freedom, if that’s how it is; but I don’t believe it. Natasha, have you thought what secret reasons  there might be?”::14/7/1938
Rocky Point::492058.6468983568::Having come to Moscow on leave a few days earlier, Boris had wished to be introduced to Prince Nikolai Andreich, and had managed to win his favor to such a degree that the prince had made him an exception among all the young bachelors, whom he did not receive.::11/5/1878
Garrett::158651.01828339245::“A blackamoor,” Nikolai finished with a joyful smile, “as if I don’t remember! And I don’t even know now if it was a blackamoor, or we dreamed it up, or somebody told it to us.”::2/7/1877
Grayland::539591.5511510546::“Friend of my heart, how are you?” he said to the sounds of the song, adjusting the pace of his horse to the pace of the company.::16/3/1856
Gilberton::35023.75836094351::“What? To whom?…You’re joking!” the count cried, his neck and nape suddenly turning an apoplectic red, as happens with old people.::21/4/1816
Withrow::406919.09309803223::“There, there—do you feel it? It’s so strange. And you know, Marie, I’ll love him very much,” said Liza, looking at her sister-in-law with shining, happy eyes. Princess Marya could not raise her head: she was weeping.::4/11/1930
Arvada::312269.21788392734::“Schon fleissig!” †183 said Rostov, still with the same joyful, brotherly smile, which never left his animated face. “Hoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen! Kaiser Alexander hoch!” ‡184 he addressed the German, repeating words often spoken by the landlord.::2/11/1846
Sudden Valley::563492.0601734767::“Yes, gentlemen, I’ve been told there’s a rumor going around Moscow that I’m a cardsharper, so I advise you to be more careful with me.”::20/3/2011
Meridian::801891.0635746183::The next day Prince Andrei went to visit certain houses he had not been to yet, among them the house of the Rostovs, with whom he had renewed his acquaintance at the last ball. Besides the rules of courtesy, according to which he ought to call on the Rostovs, Prince Andrei wanted to see at home that special, animated girl who had left him with such a pleasant memory.::1/10/1977
Aberdeen Gardens::373236.4670304948::“Why, Your Excellency, all they want is to eat well, but putting it all together and serving it is none of their business.”::1/12/1817
Possession::177017.6627218808::“Insolent fellows!” said the prince. “Do you know M&#233;tivier? I threw him out today. He was here, he was let in to see me, though I had asked them not to let anybody in,” said the prince, looking angrily at his daughter. And he recounted the whole conversation with the French doctor and the reasons why he became convinced that M&#233;tivier was a spy. Though those reasons were quite insufficient and unclear, no one objected.::12/4/2013
Independence::216501.82367423055::Our army, after repeated retreats, advances, and battles around Pultusk and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting the arrival of the sovereign and the start of a new campaign.::20/11/2005
Bickleton::765829.1997463829::Przebyszewski and his corps laid down their arms. Other columns, having lost about half their men, were retreating in disorderly, confused crowds.::23/9/2016

Doty::334734.87270028837::“Well, Denisov’s something else,” replied Nikolai, making it clear that, compared with Dolokhov, even Denisov was nothing, “you should understand what a soul Dolokhov has, you should see him with his mother, he has such a heart!”::9/10/1873
Lansing::5897.694444284119::“The means are European balance and the droit des gens, ”*43 the abb&#233; was saying. “Let a powerful state like Russia, famous for its barbarism, stand disinterestedly at the head of a union having as its purpose the balance of Europe—and it will save the world!”::5/5/1854
Newman Lake::328839.9404782241::“Very nice! What a horse he’ll be!” he said to himself and, smiling and holding his saber, ran up the steps, his spurs jingling. The German landlord, in a vest and a cap, holding the fork he was using to clear away dung, peeked out of the cowshed. As soon as he saw Rostov, the German’s face suddenly brightened. He smiled merrily and winked: “Sch&#246;n, gut Morgen! Sch&#246;n, gut Morgen!” *182 he repeated, obviously taking pleasure in greeting the young man.::17/4/1813
Freeland::512311.5229003783::Never had the amorous air in the Rostovs’ house, the atmosphere of being in love, manifested itself so strongly as during these festive days. “Seize the moments of happiness, make them love you, fall in love yourself! That is the only real thing in this world—the rest is all nonsense. And that is the one thing we’re taken up with here,” said this atmosphere.::11/1/1837
Indianola::899091.2673549296::The reason for the confusion was that, while the Austrian cavalry was moving on the left flank, the superior officers decided that our center was too far from the right flank, and the entire cavalry was ordered to cross over to the right. Several thousand cavalry were advancing ahead of the infantry, and the infantry was forced to wait.::10/9/1917
Cowiche::589522.5761787558::“Andr&#233;, I’m going to bless you with an icon, and you promise me never to take it off…Do you promise?”::2/8/1888
Husum::690659.8058015466::He spoke that refined French in which our grandparents not only spoke but thought, and with those quiet, patronizing intonations which are proper to a significant man who has grown old in society and at court. He went over to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting her with his perfumed and shining bald pate, and settled comfortably on the sofa.::9/11/1849
Pataha::170147.30790745714::“De beaux hommes!” *271 said Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier who, his face buried in the ground and his nape blackened, lay on his stomach, one of his already stiff arms flung far out.::20/3/2015
Lamona::591030.7918540343::Half an hour later the lined-up squadron was standing on the road. The command “Mount up!” rang out, the soldiers crossed themselves and began to mount up. Rostov, riding ahead, gave the command, “March!” and, stretching out four abreast, the hussars, with the sounds of hoofs splashing on the wet road, the clank of sabers, and quiet talk, started down the big, birch-lined road, in the wake of the preceding infantry and artillery.::8/1/1958
Skokomish::728719.8566565183::Lemarrois had just come galloping to Murat with the menacing letter from Bonaparte, and the shamed Murat, wishing to smooth over his mistake, at once moved his troops up to the center and around both flanks, hoping before evening and the emperor’s arrival to crush the insignificant detachment that stood facing him.::18/11/2013
Vaughn::799967.7301176233::At the moment when the horse guards, going past him, disappeared into the smoke, Rostov hesitated whether to gallop after them or ride where he was supposed to. This was that brilliant attack of the horse guards which astonished the French themselves. Rostov was horrified to hear later that, of all that mass of enormous, handsome men, of all those brilliant, rich men, youths, officers, and junkers, who had ridden past him on thousand-rouble horses, only eighteen were left after the attack.::23/7/1973
Ruby::831867.9687254201::“Rostov, come here, let’s drink from rief!” shouted Denisov, sitting down by the edge of the road in front of a flask and some food.::3/9/1859
Bryant::53395.35644194893::“No, life isn’t over at the age of thirty-one,” Prince Andrei suddenly decided definitively, immutably. “It’s not enough that I know all that’s in me, everyone else must know it, too: Pierre, and that girl who wanted to fly into the sky, everyone must know me, so that my life is not only for myself; so that they don’t live like that girl, independently of my life, but so that it is reflected in everyone, and they all live together with me!”::21/3/1957
Coalfield::905897.5056709527::Pierre, arriving first, went to Prince Andrei’s study, being a familiar of the house, and, as was his habit, at once lay down on the sofa, took the first book that caught his eye from the shelf (it was Caesar’s Commentaries ),21 and, leaning on his elbow, began reading it from the middle.::2/4/1854
Swede Heaven::960999.6100210322::“But can one get through in a sleigh?” he asked the steward, who accompanied him back to the house, a respectable man, in face and manner resembling his master.::5/1/1997
El Monte::288926.10121990525::“Yerzinka! Dearie!” wailed Ilagin in a voice not his own. Yerza did not heed his prayer. At the very moment she was expected to seize the hare, he swerved and flew out to the boundary between the green fields and the stubble. Again Yerza and Milka, like a team of horses, straightened up and sped after the hare; it was easier for him to run along the boundary, and dogs could not close in on him so quickly.::22/1/1961
Brady::701321.6957891468::Rostov fearfully began to justify himself, but seeing the general’s good-naturedly joking face, led him aside and in an agitated voice told him the whole affair, begging the general to intercede for Denisov, whom he knew. The general listened to Rostov, shaking his head gravely.::25/4/1830
Spring Glen::360393.85980366234::“Countess…” said Denisov, with lowered eyes and a guilty look, and he was about to say something more, but faltered.::13/6/2005
Hoodsport::509241.92830876925::“The hoof’s cracked! It’s nothing. I’ll teach you, I’ll show you what sort of clinch nail to put on it.”::15/4/1836
Springfield::300305.9166901377::“I humbly thank you, Prince,” replied one of the officers, taking pleasure in conversing with such an important staff official. “An excellent place. We passed just by the park, saw two deer, and such a wonderful house!”::17/8/1862
Tanglewilde::160360.67703661183::Prince Andrei, with a radiant, rapturous face, renewed towards life, stopped before Pierre and, not noticing his sad face, smiled at him with the egoism of happiness.::17/12/1943
Bow::713135.1888250589::“Il est tr&#232;s mauvais, votre jeu de mots, tr&#232;s spirituel, mais injuste,”  said Anna Pavlovna, shaking her shriveled finger. “Nous ne faisons pas la guerre pour le Roi de Prusse, mais pour les bons principes. Ah, le m&#233;chant, ce prince Hyppolite!” §306 she said.::6/1/1828
Carlsborg::641672.507172118::“But you’d better not gamble,” Dolokhov added, and, flexing a newly opened deck, he said: “Bank, gentlemen!”::17/3/1911
North Lynnwood::204836.79510259812::The count turned and to his right saw Mitka, who was looking at the count with popping eyes and, raising his cap,4 was pointing ahead of him to the other side.::14/11/1887
Cedar Falls::199459.71361742477::“Splendid!” he cried. “He’ll get you and your dowry and incidentally take along Mlle Bourienne. She’ll be his wife, and you…”::13/10/1884
Fairfield::251875.0155155878::“I tell you, there’ll be a purse,” Denisov shouted, shaking the orderly by the shoulder and pushing him against the wall.::24/10/1860
Clearwater::297882.76656710624::There was nothing bad or inappropriate in what they said, everything was witty and might have been funny; but that something which constitutes the salt of merriment was not only missing, but they did not even know it existed.::3/6/1885
Peoria::964329.6274167034::The uncle played another song, then a waltz; then, after a pause, he cleared his throat and struck up his favorite hunting song:::22/12/1904
Brownsville::5152.5076668068605::“If Bonaparte remains on the throne of France for another year,” the viscount continued the new conversation, with the air of a man who does not listen to others, but, in matters known better to him than to anyone else, follows only the train of his own thoughts, “things will go too far. Intrigues, coercion, banishments, executions will forever destroy French society—I mean good society—and then…”::6/10/1864
Amber::419448.59736437025::Sitting in his former schoolroom, on the sofa with padded armrests, and looking into Natasha’s desperately lively eyes, Rostov again entered that world of his family and childhood, which had no meaning for anyone but him, but which had provided him with one of the best enjoyments in life; and the burning of the arm with a ruler to show love did not seem nonsense to him; he understood and was not surprised at it.::5/7/2010
Zenith::219791.5779075037::“Oooh! Leave me alone, for Christ’s sake,” the wounded man cried; but all the same they lifted him up and laid him on the stretcher.::24/4/2001
Goodnoe Hills::877795.9011989996::“I cannot, General, and the reason why I cannot is that the law is stronger than I,” said the sovereign, and he raised his foot to the stirrup. The general inclined his head deferentially, the sovereign mounted and rode down the street at a gallop. Rostov, beside himself with rapture, ran after him with the crowd.::19/3/1901
Rochester::979570.5436769157::“But how do you find all this latest comedy du sacre de Milan, ”14 asked Anna Pavlovna. “Et la nouvelle com&#233;die des peuples de G&#234;nes et de Lucques, qui viennent pr&#233;senter leurs voeux &#224; M. Buonaparte. M. Buonaparte assis sur un tr&#244;ne, et exau&#231;ant les voeux des nations! Adorable! Non, mais c’est &#224; en devenir folle!

Olalla::330562.5587607378::“A fine one, to say the least! a fine lad!…His father’s lying on his deathbed, and he’s having fun, sitting a policeman on the back of a bear! Shame on you, old boy, shame on you! You’d do better to go to the war.”::18/9/1836
Basin City::311169.96399662475::At that same time, Andrei was sitting with Pierre and telling him of his love for Natasha and of his firm intention to marry her.::5/2/1894
Carlsbad::274159.0406610671::Morning came with its cares and bustle. Everybody got up, began to move, to talk, again the dressmakers came, again Marya Dmitrievna came out, and tea was served. Natasha looked at them all uneasily, with wide-open eyes, as if she wanted to catch every glance directed at her, and tried to seem the same as she always was.::10/3/1948
Westminster::656226.7516683949::The whole aim of his speech now was obviously to exalt himself and insult Alexander, that is, to do the thing he had least wanted to do at the beginning of the meeting.::6/8/1978
Orchards::624253.9599001815::“A whole ye-e-ear!” Natasha said suddenly, only now understanding that the wedding was to be postponed for a year. “But why a year? Why a year?…” Prince Andrei began to explain to her the reasons for this postponement. Natasha did not listen to him.::23/4/1982
West Jordan::980439.774261318::“About Boris…I know,” she said seriously, “that’s what I came for. Don’t tell me, I know. No, tell me!” She took her hand away. “Tell me, mama. Isn’t he sweet?”::1/2/1811
Mead::355756.3239418944::“And I remember being told that you were born under a cabbage,” Natasha said, “and I remember not daring to disbelieve it then, but I knew it wasn’t true, and I felt so awkward.”::11/12/1820
Manzanita::227629.38945385336::For her part, Mlle Bourienne did not miss her chance, at the word Paris,  to enter as well into the general conversation of reminiscences.::6/12/1888
Pearland::762246.6648300098::Lemarrois had just come galloping to Murat with the menacing letter from Bonaparte, and the shamed Murat, wishing to smooth over his mistake, at once moved his troops up to the center and around both flanks, hoping before evening and the emperor’s arrival to crush the insignificant detachment that stood facing him.::21/10/1809
Touchet::318930.0486122556::“Stop them!” he cried, and at the same time, probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right.::23/10/1991
Richardson::820576.9698298546::Sonya had not seen anything, she had been just about to blink her eyes and get up when she heard Natasha’s voice say “She’s sure to…” She did not want to disappoint either Dunyasha or Natasha, and it was hard to go on sitting there. She did not know how and why that cry had escaped her when she covered her eyes with her hand.::15/9/1802
Sappho::615670.1648049732::“Wonderful!” said Natasha. “One could just fall in love with her!” At that moment the last chords of the overture sounded and the conductor tapped with his baton. The late-coming men went to their seats in the parterre and the curtain rose.::25/11/1970
Hunters::27523.298013917953::“I bid you welcome. I know, I know,” said the count, kissing and embracing Denisov. “Nikolushka wrote to us…Natasha, Vera, here’s Denisov.”::16/6/1886
Gleed::532334.8379853924::“Here I’ve got Pryanichnikov serving under me, a nice man, good as gold, but he’s sixty—is he going to take examinations?…”::21/8/1895
Downey::581009.801591034::“Well, that ends that, my dear. Very glad to see you, very glad to see you. Go to your room, Princess, go,” said the old prince. “Very, very glad to see you,” he repeated, putting his arm around Prince Vassily.::20/10/1811
Torboy::492105.9855065254::No one in the house ordered so many people around or gave them so much work as Natasha. She could not look at people indifferently, without sending them somewhere. It seemed as if she were testing whether any of them would get angry or upset with her, but people liked carrying out Natasha’s orders as they did no one else’s. “What shall I do? Where shall I go?” thought Natasha, walking slowly down the corridor.::21/3/1868
Miami Gardens::319112.99795703375::Instead of the demand four months earlier that he withdraw from Pomerania, now they demanded only that he withdraw beyond the Niemen. Napoleon turned quickly and started pacing the room.::9/3/1804
Willapa::806203.7968328035::“What is this? like sheep! just like sheep! Away!…clear the road! Wait, you there! you with the cart, you devil! I’ll take my sword to you!” he shouted, actually drawing his saber and beginning to wave it.::13/2/1887
Temecula::823536.8126101044::Bagration called to the officer, and Tushin went over to the general, putting three fingers to his visor in a timid and awkward movement, not as military men salute, but as priests bless. Though Tushin’s guns were meant to be shooting into the hollow, he was sending fireballs at the village of Sch&#246;ngraben visible straight ahead, before which large masses of French were moving forward.::12/4/1937
Costa Mesa::261030.42326112778::“I’m not afraid,” Sonya’s voice replied, and her little feet, screeching and squeaking in their thin shoes, went down the path towards Nikolai.::8/11/1831
Finley::555108.0006701318::“It comes over him, Your Excellency, some days,” said the captain. “He’s clever, and learned, and kind. And then he’s a beast. In Poland he all but killed a Jew, if you want to know…”::15/10/1921
College Station::953975.2143909935::“Ah, Bondarenko, friend of my heart,” he said to the hussar who came rushing for his horse. “Give him a cooling down, my friend,” he said with that merry brotherly tenderness with which all fine young men treat everyone when they are happy.::5/5/1852
Picnic Point::457039.05877207953::The regimental commander had so wanted to do that, he had been so sorry that he had had no time to do it, that it seemed to him that all this was exactly so. And perhaps it really was so? As if one could make out in that confusion what was and was not so?::17/6/1974
Aeneas::784119.3192175908::“Right you are!…I just knew,” the uncle began (he was a distant relation, a none-too-wealthy neighbor of the Rostovs), “I just knew you wouldn’t stay home, and it’s a good thing you didn’t. Right you are!” (This was the uncle’s favorite saying.) “Take the reserve at once, because my Girchik told me the Ilagins are at Korniki with their hunt. They’ll snatch the litter—right you are!—straight out from under your nose.”::6/5/1800
Cedarhurst::509328.7203144664::Instead of an enemy, Nikolai found in Ilagin a respectable, courteous gentleman, especially desirous of making the young count’s acquaintance. Riding up to Rostov, Ilagin raised his beaver cap and said that he very much regretted what had happened, said that he would order the hunter punished for allowing himself to hunt from under another man’s dogs, asked to make the count’s acquaintance, and offered him his own hunting spots.::13/5/1960
Four Lakes::475895.0947249954::“So I’m just like all the rest, when it’s not a matter of the chase. Well, but when it is, watch out!” was, as it seemed to Nikolai, what the dog’s look said.::5/1/1895
Elgin::597140.0207397164::The uncle led his guests through the front hall into a small reception room with a folding table and red chairs, then to a drawing room with a round birch table and a sofa, then to the study, with a torn sofa, a worn rug, and portraits of Suvorov, the host’s father and mother, and himself in military uniform. The study smelled strongly of tobacco and dogs.::4/3/1925
Port Madison::704940.6855890685::Bagration looked over his suite with his big, expressionless, sleepy eyes, and Rostov’s childlike face, involuntarily transfixed with excitement and hope, was the first thing that struck his eye. He sent him.::9/7/1828
Murrieta::930907.5410469555::“Princess Drubetskoy to see Prince Vassily Sergeevich,” he called out to the servant in stockings, shoes, and a tailcoat, who had come running down and was now peering from the turn of the stairway.::7/12/1930
Wheeler::726544.2330587624::At the beginning of winter, Prince Nikolai Andreich Bolkonsky came to Moscow with his daughter. Because of his past, because of his intelligence and originality, and especially because of the weakening just then of the raptures over the reign of Alexander I, and because of the anti-French and patriotic tendencies which reigned at that time in Moscow, Prince Nikolai Andreich at once became an object of special deference among the Muscovites and the center of Moscow opposition to the government.::25/7/1804
Gresham::187127.49405748973::On business to do with the trusteeship of the Ryazan estates, Prince Andrei had to see the provincial marshal of nobility. The marshal was Count Ilya Andreevich Rostov, and in the middle of May Prince Andrei went to see him.::8/9/1844

Marrowstone::129091.52283383896::“And I love her, because she has a sensible character—a very good one. Take the other sister—same family, but something quite different, an unpleasant character, and none of that intelligence, and all that, you know?…It’s unpleasant…But my fianc&#233;e…You must come to…” Berg went on; he was about to say “to dinner,” but changed his mind and said “to tea,” and with a quick movement of his tongue let out a small, round smoke ring that fully embodied his dreams of happiness.::11/9/1928
North Puyallup::530541.7153830288::Opening the door to the reception room, Pierre saw Natasha sitting by the window with a thin, pale, and spiteful face. She glanced at him, frowned, and, with an expression of cold dignity, left the room.::8/10/1858
Five Corners::465928.66198170744::“C’est fait!” *259 she said to the count, pointing with a solemn gesture to the countess, who was holding the snuffbox with the portrait in one hand and the letter in the other, and pressing her lips first to the one, then to the other.::25/1/1884
Graham::199839.31917874387::“I’ve received news. He’s not among the prisoners, and not among the dead. Kutuzov writes,” he cried shrilly, as if wishing to drive the princess away with this cry, “he’s been killed!”::18/12/2007
Longview Heights::540015.1164158692::“Ah! The warrior! So you want to defeat Bonaparte?” said the old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the braided queue, which was in Tikhon’s hands, would let him. “At least give him a good drubbing, or pretty soon he’ll be writing us down, too, as his subjects. Greetings!” And he offered his cheek.::5/7/1963
Hobart::838948.2873766855::“I don’t believe I’ve said anything to you, Masha, about reproaching my wife for anything or being displeased with her. Why are you saying all this to me?”::16/6/1903
Point Roberts::474957.6933218438::The halted infantry soldiers, crowding in the trampled mud by the bridge, gazed at the clean, foppish hussars going past them in order, with that special feeling of ill will, alienation, and mockery with which different branches of the military usually meet each other.::18/2/1992
Town and Country::398402.7950029382::“I thank you all, gentlemen, all the branches acted heroically: infantry, cavalry, and artillery. How is it that two guns in the center were abandoned?” he asked, seeking someone with his eyes. (Prince Bagration did not ask about the guns of the left flank; he already knew that all the cannon there had been abandoned at the very beginning.) “I asked you to go, I believe,” he turned to the staff officer on duty.::18/6/1848
Lake Hills::241575.15503942105::“No, I was only surprised that you’ve left the regiment. Dans un moment je suis &#224; vous, ”*329 he replied to a voice that was calling him.::22/6/1856
Rosedale::969507.5823739783::“What nonsense sometimes comes into one’s head!” thought Prince Andrei. “But the one sure thing is that this girl is so sweet, so special, that she won’t spend a month dancing here before she gets married…It’s a rarity here,” he thought, as Natasha, straightening a rose that had gone awry on her corsage, was sitting down beside him.::10/6/1936
Irondale::815678.4158574344::“Two days ago on the Danube,” a soldier replied. Prince Andrei took out a purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces.::5/12/1949
Dishman::88094.3619919331::Five minutes later Denisov came into the shed, climbed onto the bed in his muddy boots, angrily smoked his pipe, scattered all his belongings around, strapped on his riding whip and saber, and started out of the dugout. To Rostov’s question, where to?—he answered angrily and vaguely that there was business to be done.::18/7/1860
Bayview::202840.21571241828::“Devil knows about them! He’s beaten everybody! Perish them all!” answers came in Russian, German, and Czech from the crowds of fleeing men who, like himself, did not understand what was going on there.::2/6/1835

Lochsloy::476305.56710724416::“Trifles!” the colonel boomed. “Two hussars wounded and one killed on the spot, ” he said with obvious joy, unable to hold back a happy smile, sonorously rapping out the beautiful phrase killed on the spot.::8/5/1847
Brinnon::801048.4799693781::But then, seeing her father and especially little Coco, her intention would weaken, she would weep in quiet and feel she was a sinful woman: she loved her father and her nephew more than God.::22/10/1883
Seahurst::497960.4636423939::Davout looked at him silently, and the slight trouble and confusion expressed on Balashov’s face clearly afforded him pleasure.::6/4/1822
Dixie::96084.30224845765::The two girls in white dresses, with identical roses in their dark hair, curtsied identically, but the hostess involuntarily rested her gaze longer on the slender Natasha. She looked at her and smiled at her alone with a special smile, in addition to her hostess smile. Gazing at her, the hostess may have remembered the golden, irretrievable time of her girlhood, and her own first ball. The host also followed Natasha with his eyes and asked the count which one was his daughter.::24/10/1948
Eastgate::342710.68130594917::The princess went to the door, passed by it with a significant, indifferent look, and peeked into the drawing room. Pierre and H&#233;l&#232;ne were sitting and talking in the same way.::19/4/1879

Buena::447790.7544697365::“Mais, ma pauvre Catiche, c’est clair comme le jour .*121 He alone is then the legitimate heir to everything, and you won’t get even this much. You must know, my dear, whether the will and the letter were written, and whether they have been destroyed. And if they’ve been overlooked for some reason, you must know where they are and must find them, because…”::10/7/1806
Grapeview::67520.51641316547::The countess, learning at once through the maids of what had happened in the wing, was, on the one hand, calmed by the reflection that their situation should now be set to rights, but, on the other hand, was troubled by the thought of how her son would put up with it. She tiptoed to his door several times, listening as he smoked one pipe after another.::4/4/1961
Startup::957050.3809873026::“I beg Your Majesty’s pardon,” said Balashov, “besides Russia there is also Spain, where there are just as many churches and monasteries.”::10/1/1985
Hayford::603211.4996600186::During the entr’acte there was a gust of cold in H&#233;l&#232;ne’s box, the door opened, and Anatole came in, ducking his head and trying not to snag on anyone.::22/11/1964

Southworth::561794.8426022326::“Who’s that running in the middle of the bridge? Keep to the right! Back, junker!” he cried out angrily and turned to Denisov, who, flaunting his courage, rode out onto the planks of the bridge.::22/4/2019
Cambridge::718949.1649759525::Having come on Tuesday evening to H&#233;l&#232;ne’s magnificent salon, Boris was not given a clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to come.

Milan::14137.197640823219::“And it can’t be otherwise?” she asked. Prince Andrei said nothing, but his face expressed the impossibility of changing this decision.::12/5/1959
Lowell::347168.40371198574::“He knows everything,” said Marya Dmitrievna, pointing to Pierre and addressing Natasha. “Let him tell you whether I’ve spoken the truth.”::25/3/2004
Lake Goodwin::634807.1415451345::Everything fell silent again, but Prince Andrei knew that she was still sitting up there, he heard an occasional quiet stirring, an occasional sigh.::5/1/1913
McMurray::804736.8724674637::Despite the fact that someone’s carriage was standing at the entrance, the porter, having looked over the mother and son (who, without asking to be announced, had walked directly through the glass entryway between two rows of statues in niches), with a significant glance at the old mantle, asked whom they wanted to see, the princesses or the count, and, on learning that it was the count, said that his excellency was feeling worse that day, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone.::13/5/1824
Portage::701051.7931791183::“Laissez-moi, laissez-moi, tout &#231;a m’est parfaitement &#233;gal,” #245 answered a voice barely holding back its tears.::19/12/1807
Lake Bosworth::939034.5896054313::The two generals and the adjutants began snatching at the field glass, pulling it away from each other.

Fords Prairie::225470.60574361467::“You mustn’t, you mustn’t!” a frightened voice said from inside. He started pacing the room. The cries ceased, another few seconds went by.

Carson::778689.1343292837::Having come on Tuesday evening to H&#233;l&#232;ne’s magnificent salon, Boris was not given a clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to come.

Mount Vista::65145.36080172651::“That I will not promise you. You know how besieged Kutuzov has been since he was appointed commander in chief.13 He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies are conspiring to send their children to be his adjutants.”::13/8/1983
Manchester::525794.6862368978::He spoke that refined French in which our grandparents not only spoke but thought, and with those quiet, patronizing intonations which are proper to a significant man who has grown old in society and at court.

Espanola::115710.0000189597::A week later, having said good-bye to his new Mason friends and having left them large sums for alms, Pierre went off to his estates. His new brothers gave him letters to the Masons of Kiev and Odessa and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity.::1/12/1989
Billings::904364.729215512::“More, more, step it up!” he addressed these sounds mentally, and again started riding along the line, penetrating further and further into the area of the troops already going into action.::19/12/1986
Summitview::167493.58957337856::“Delighted, delighted,” he said and, looking her intently in the eye once again, quickly stepped away and sat down in his place. “Sit down, sit down! Mikhail Ivanovich, sit down.”::1/2/2011

Prince Andrei stopped.::2/2/1855
Queets::533274.6658642854::The affair was presented by the offended side in such guise that, after seizing the transport, Major Denisov, uninvited, in a drunken state, appeared at the quartermaster general’s, called him a thief, threatened him with a beating, and, when removed, rushed into the office, attacked two clerks, and dislocated the arm of one.::24/9/1910
Wollochet::122804.31977958028::“How can they not only live here, but even laugh?” thought Rostov, still sensing that smell of dead flesh he had picked up in the soldiers’ section, and still seeing around him those envious looks that had followed after him on both sides and the face of the young soldier with rolled-up eyes.::24/11/1821
Pueblo::436448.9259008942::The squadron overtook the infantry and artillery, which also speeded up, went down a hill and, passing through some empty, deserted village, rode uphill again. The horses began to lather, the men’s faces became flushed.::14/10/1913

Glenwood::899701.2115987332::“Come, come, dearest uncle,” Natasha moaned in such an imploring voice as though her life depended on it.

Riverbend::620762.2002339716::“Gentlemen, I’ll do anything, nobody will hear a word from me,” Rostov said in a pleading voice, “but apologize I cannot, by God, I cannot, do what you will! How am I going to apologize, like a little boy asking forgiveness?”::22/8/1922

Trout Lake::685013.9824028652::His wound, despite its insignificance, still had not healed, though it was now six weeks since he was wounded. His face had the same pale swollenness of all the hospital faces. But it was not this that struck Rostov: what struck him was that Denisov did not seem glad to see him and smiled at him unnaturally. Denisov did not ask about the regiment, nor about the general course of affairs. When Rostov mentioned it, Denisov did not listen.::5/11/1994
Centennial::167487.39881028296::“Gentlemen, I’ll do anything, nobody will hear a word from me,” Rostov said in a pleading voice, “but apologize I cannot, by God, I cannot, do what you will! How am I going to apologize, like a little boy asking forgiveness?”::2/7/1917

Pompano Beach::802600.4504914912::Przebyszewski and his corps laid down their arms. Other columns, having lost about half their men, were retreating in disorderly, confused crowds.::7/2/1809
Oysterville::585409.7502167886::As soon as the uhlans had gone down the hill, the hussars were ordered to move up the hill to cover the battery. While the hussars took the place of the uhlans, bullets came flying from the front line, whining and whistling, missing their aim by far.::8/9/1928
North Charleston::810997.461209788::But then, seeing her father and especially little Coco, her intention would weaken, she would weep in quiet and feel she was a sinful woman: she loved her father and her nephew more than God.::15/3/2016
Melbourne::541394.4236559798::“Off with you to your Buonaparte, then. Mademoiselle Bourienne, voil&#224; encore un admirateur de votre goujat d’empereur! ”*167 he shouted in excellent French.::22/10/1886
Plymouth::334229.97614790197::“This meeting might be hard on him, ch&#232;re  Anna Mikhailovna,” he said. “Let’s wait till evening; the doctors have predicted a crisis.”::13/3/1862
Everett::909284.0506377912::“Yes, yes, I love him!” thought Natasha, rereading the letter for the twentieth time and seeking some special, deep meaning in each word.::14/8/1931
Satsop::78332.8858120832::All his life, at every moment, he possessed the faculty of seeing phenomena in the detached finality of each separate instant, in perfectly distinct outline, as we see only on rare occasions, in childhood, or on the crest of an all-renewing happiness, or in the triumph of a great spiritual victory.::25/6/1838
Merritt::460970.17460126674::Anna Mikhailovna briefly recounted to Natasha the contents of the letter, on condition that she not tell anyone.::10/9/1916
Peshastin::952527.8958351208::“Tell me, my dear,” she said, addressing Natasha, “what is this Mimi to you? Your daughter, it must be?”::19/10/1911
Marble::800382.5952185955::Though Nikolai Rostov, keeping firmly to his intention, went on serving in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little money, the way of life at Otradnoe was such, and Mitenka in particular so conducted business, that the debts mounted irresistibly every year. The only help the old count could evidently envisage was government service, and he went to Petersburg to seek a post; to seek a post and at the same time, as he said, to amuse the girls for the last time.::2/7/1996
South Snohomish::960782.9090684807::“Rot! Foolishness! Rot, rot, rot!” shouted Prince Nikolai Andreich, frowning, and taking his daughter by the hand, he pulled her to him and did not kiss her, but, leaning his forehead to her forehead, touched it, and squeezed her hand, which he was holding, so hard that she winced and cried out.::5/2/1879
Richmond Highlands::600308.2471667738::“And still the only thing I love and cherish is triumph over all of them, I cherish that mysterious power and glory hovering over me here in this mist!”::23/4/1903
Waterbury::797721.7881144813::“&#201;coutez, ch&#232;re Annette,”  said the prince, suddenly taking his interlocutor by the hand and pulling it down for some reason. “Arrangez-moi cette affaire et je suis votre  faithful slave &#224; tout jamais  (slafe—comme mon  village headman &#233;crit des  reports: f  instead of v ).**23 She’s from a good family and rich. That’s all I need.”::23/9/1805
Nisqually::414365.83283939::As soon as the curtain rose, the boxes and parterre all fell silent, and all the men, old and young, in uniforms and tailcoats, all the women, in precious stones on bare bodies, with greedy curiosity turned their attention to the stage. Natasha also began to look.::15/3/1898
Tillicum::33794.740411237755::“Ah, you’ll just disturb the old man!” said the countess. “And there’s no room to turn around in his place. If you go anywhere, it should be to the Melyukovs’.”::11/8/1896
Anatone::862616.0240764059::Judging by the calmly moderate and friendly tone with which the French emperor spoke, Balashov was firmly convinced that he wanted peace and intended to enter into negotiations.::24/4/1846
Tulalip::455348.99474413216::“My friend, what have you done in Moscow? Why did you quarrel with Lelya, mon cher?  You are mistaken,” said Prince Vassily as he came in. “I’ve found out everything and can tell you for certain that H&#233;l&#232;ne is as innocent before you as Christ before the Jews.”::6/3/1850
Orient::467771.7619208015::On the twelfth of November, Kutuzov’s active army, camped near Olm&#252;tz, was preparing to be reviewed the next day by two emperors—Russian and Austrian. The guards, just arrived from Russia, were spending the night some ten miles from Olm&#252;tz, and the next day would come straight to the review, entering the field at Olm&#252;tz by ten o’clock in the morning.::16/4/1893
Dieringer::604320.8038234308::Prince Vassily pondered and winced. Anna Mikhailovna understood that he feared to find in her a rival over Count Bezukhov’s will. She hastened to reassure him.::6/8/1801
Frederickson::704648.8019271488::In Petersburg, just as in Moscow, an atmosphere of affectionate, loving people surrounded Pierre. He could not refuse the post or, rather, the rank (because he did nothing) that Prince Vassily had provided him with, and the acquaintances, invitations, social occupations were so many that Pierre experienced, even more than in Moscow, a feeling of fogginess, hurriedness, and some ever approaching but never attained good.::7/12/1849
Keller::758667.4946289909::Moving money forward, Dolokhov prepared to keep the bank. Rostov sat beside him and at first did not play. Dolokhov kept glancing at him.::7/9/1897
Marblemount::455054.82308508095::Weyrother again smiled that same ironic smile, which said that to him  it was ridiculous and strange to meet objections from Russian generals and prove that of which he was not only all too well assured himself, but of which he had assured the two emperors.::8/8/2000
Turner::387845.1735218333::But the colonel did not finish everything he wanted to say. A cannonball flew close to him and made him duck and crouch down on his horse. He fell silent and was about to say something more when another cannonball stopped him. He turned his horse and galloped away.::5/7/1980
West Palm Beach::417459.0854366138::“What’s there to look at?” said the assistant. But precisely because the assistant obviously did not want to let him go in, Rostov entered the soldiers’ wards. Here the stench, which he had managed to get used to in the corridor, was still stronger. The stench here was slightly different: it was sharper, and one could sense that it was coming precisely from here.::23/4/1862
Boulder::933467.4302701375::Prince Andrei did not reply. The carriage and horses had long been led out on the other side and hitched up, and the sun had already half disappeared, and the evening frost had covered the pools by the crossing with stars, but Pierre and Andrei, to the astonishment of the lackeys, coachmen, and ferrymen, were still standing on the ferry and talking.::2/9/1999
Riner::541829.121187556::“One more question, Count,” he said, “which I ask you to answer not as a future Mason, but as an honest man (galant homme),  in all sincerity: have you renounced your former convictions, do you believe in God?”::5/9/1822
Powhatan::497296.00984337484::“Leave it,” said Dolokhov, though it seemed he was not even looking at Rostov, “you’ll win it back the sooner. I let the others win, but you I beat. Or are you afraid of me?” he repeated.::22/5/1844
Natural Bridge::902081.5981673661::“To whom you suppose that I belong?” Prince Andrei said calmly and with an especially pleasant smile.::13/3/1940
Chamberlayne Heights::961648.4031967693::“Let him be,” Marya Genrikhovna said with a timid and happy smile, “he’s sleeping well as it is after a sleepless night.”::3/2/1918
West Covina::684768.0761644287::“Le prince Hyppolite Kouragine—charmant jeune homme. Monsieur Kroug, charg&#233; d’affaires de Kopenhague—un esprit profond,”  and simply: “Monsieur Shittoff, un homme de beaucoup de m&#233;rite,” *297 of the one who bore that title.::14/3/1937
McClure::246531.36891187166::“Ah, you know him?” said Mme Peronsky. “I can’t bear him. Il fait &#224; pr&#233;sent la pluie et le beau temps. *347 And such boundless pride! Takes after his papa. Got in with Speransky, drafting some sort of projects. Look how he treats the ladies! She’s talking to him, and he turns away,” she said, pointing to him. “I’d give it to him, if he behaved with me the way he does with these ladies.”::20/10/1962
Brownsburg::357574.5062273567::“But if for some reason you find conversation with me unpleasant,” said the old man, “say so, my dear sir.” And he suddenly smiled an unexpectedly gentle, fatherly smile.::4/7/1810
Burgess::578296.8205370452::After this outburst, the prince never once spoke of the matter again. But his suppressed vexation with his son’s faint-heartedness showed itself in the relations between father and daughter. To the previous subjects of mockery a new one was added—talk about stepmothers and his amiability towards Mlle Bourienne.::24/9/2003
Lake Barcroft::395407.2326188461::“Villains! Scoundrels!” cried the old man, pulling his face away from her. “To destroy an army, to destroy men! Why? Go, go and tell Liza.”::20/8/1938
Clover::132532.0988622376::“No, gentlemen, you’ve had enough sleep, and I haven’t slept for two nights,” the doctor said and gloomily sat down beside to his wife, waiting for the game to end.::23/6/1953
Broken Arrow::174451.7619116467::“How, then? With all your mass you fell upon the unfortunate Mortier with his one division, and this Mortier slips between your fingers? Where’s the victory?”::5/3/1857
Verona::338786.17485136143::“Marry, marry, dear boy…They’re of good stock!…Clever people, eh? Rich, eh? Yes. A fine stepmother for Nikolushka. Write him that he can marry tomorrow even. She’ll be Nikolushka’s stepmother, and I’ll marry little Bourienne!…Ha, ha, ha, so he won’t be without a stepmother himself! Only one thing, there’s no need for more women in my house; let him marry and live separately. Maybe you’ll move in with him?” he turned to Princess Marya. “God help you, and good riddance…good riddance!…”::10/5/1985
Clovis::62957.41730853266::“It would have been hard to get through, Your Excellency,” the steward added. “So we’ve heard, Your Excellency, that a minister is going to be visiting Your Excellency?”::5/9/1875
Falmouth::723331.6903166964::“You see, my most gentle sir, I have read your memorandum,” Arakcheev interrupted, speaking only the first words benignly, again without looking him in the face and lapsing more and more into a grumblingly contemptuous tone. “Proposing new military regulations? There are many regulations, and no one to carry out the old ones. Everybody writes regulations these days; it’s easier to write them than to follow them.”::22/4/1815
Daly City::515464.99229114095::The entire suite now drew back, and Rostov saw the general speak about something with the sovereign for a rather long time.::1/1/1814
Ashburn::38554.73100289075::“No, but I have fallen in love and will fall in love a thousand times, though I have no such feeling of friendship, trust, and love for anyone but you. Besides, I’m young. Maman  doesn’t want it. Well, simply, I don’t promise anything. And I ask you to think about Dolokhov’s proposal,” he said, speaking his friend’s name with difficulty.::8/2/1800
Lakeland::938654.3977960611::“That’s better, Count!” the staff captain repeated, as if beginning to call him by his title on account of his acknowledgment. “Go and apologize, Your Excellency, yes, sir.”::24/8/1866
Gwynn::960337.7767219029::Rostov, not taking his eyes away, despite the trampling of the French gendarmes’ horses, attempting to move the crowd back, followed every movement of the emperor Alexander and Bonaparte. He was struck, as if it was unexpected, by the fact that Alexander behaved as an equal with Bonaparte, and that Bonaparte, quite freely, as if such closeness to the sovereign was natural and habitual to him, treated the Russian tsar as an equal.::17/5/1999
Jewell Valley::993567.136502725::“Laissez-moi, laissez-moi, tout &#231;a m’est parfaitement &#233;gal,” #245 answered a voice barely holding back its tears.::6/10/2004
Santa Maria::370780.28511126834::Tushin appeared in the doorway, timidly making his way from behind the generals’ backs. Going around the generals in the crowded cottage, embarrassed as usual at the sight of his superiors, Tushin did not see the staff of the standard and stumbled over it. Several voices laughed.::17/4/1918
University Heights::136090.5161564008::“They barely managed to save the poor fellow,” the guest went on. “That’s how intelligently the son of Count Kirill Vladimirovich Bezukhov amuses himself!” she added. “And I heard he was so well-bred and intelligent. There’s what all this foreign upbringing leads to. I hope no one receives him here, despite his wealth. They wanted to introduce him to me. I decidedly refused: I have daughters.”::2/9/1908
Batesville::582428.2692650538::“Dieu sait quand reviendra…”  the prince sang off-key, laughed still more off-key, and left the table.::24/5/1848
Whitetop::256711.6042193246::Natasha listened with concentrated attention, trying to understand the meaning of his words, and not understanding.::21/9/1857
Nellysford::840790.7129219031::“And why should you believe that he is my lover?…Why? Because I like his company? If you were more intelligent and agreeable, I’d prefer yours.”::18/6/1898
Montrose::729174.8350134536::When Pierre returned to Moscow, he was handed a letter from Marya Dmitrievna, who asked him to come to her on a very important matter concerning Andrei Bolkonsky and his fianc&#233;e. Pierre had been avoiding Natasha. It seemed to him that he had a stronger feeling for her than a married man ought to have for his friend’s fianc&#233;e. Yet some sort of fate constantly brought them together.::10/1/1803
Norwalk::75938.15718212993::“Count, Count!” cried Berg, as animated as Boris, running up to him from the other side. “Count, I’m wounded in the right hand,” he said, showing his hand, bloody and bandaged with a handkerchief, “and I stayed in the line. I hold the sword in my left hand, Count: our race, the von Bergs, Count, were all knights.”::13/11/1943
Sandy Springs::809632.8683355136::“What silliness!” cried Natasha, laughing. “I don’t want to think or know about him or anybody else.”::7/9/1877
Dante::855085.7299259614::“Very well, be so good as to wait,” he said to the general in Russian, with that French pronunciation which he used when he wanted to speak disdainfully, and, noticing Boris and no longer addressing the general (who pleadingly ran after him asking to be heard out), Prince Andrei turned to Boris with a cheerful smile, nodding to him.::18/4/1986
Hillsboro::871589.6411537853::“Typhus, my lad. Anyone who comes here is a dead man. There’s only the two of us, me and Makeev” (he pointed to the assistant) “still hanging on here. Five of our fellow doctors have already died. A new one comes, after one little week he’s finished,” the doctor said with visible pleasure. “Prussian doctors were invited, but our allies don’t find it to their liking.”::9/6/1981
Green Bay::365816.94491304783::“No, wait,” said Anatole. “Close the door, we have to sit down.15 There.” They closed the door and sat down.::12/7/1879
Wintergreen::449752.6716384982::Having come on Tuesday evening to H&#233;l&#232;ne’s magnificent salon, Boris was not given a clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to come. There were other guests, the countess spoke little to him, and only as he kissed her hand on taking his leave did she, with a strange absence of a smile, unexpectedly, in a whisper, say to him:::13/2/1882
Vesta::562414.001618669::“Captain, for God’s sake, I’ve bruised my arm,” he said timidly. “For God’s sake, I can’t walk. For God’s sake!”::24/5/1921
Henry::899492.814265388::At the beginning of March, the old count Ilya Andreevich Rostov was taken up with arranging a dinner at the English Club in honor of Prince Bagration.::12/9/2001
Tyler::835804.4810889678::“Little countess,” the count’s voice came from outside the door. “Are you asleep?” Natasha jumped up barefoot and, snatching her slippers, ran to her room.::10/12/1923
Evington::849992.8130999232::Princess Marya’s embarrassment for her people  was totally unnecessary. They were not in the least intimidated. The little old woman, her eyes lowered and casting sidelong glances at the newcomers, turned her teacup bottom up on the saucer and, placing the nibbled piece of sugar beside it, sat calm and motionless in her armchair, waiting to be offered more tea. Ivanushka, sipping from the saucer, looked at the young men from under his brows with his sly feminine eyes.::12/7/2010
Wichita Falls::377252.71631712466::For him it was no new conviction that his presence at all ends of the world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy, struck people in the same way and threw them into the madness of self-oblivion. He ordered his horse brought and rode to his camp.::21/3/1850
Lewisville::250195.8250236124::It was clear that this junker had already asked for a seat more than once elsewhere and everywhere had been refused. He asked in an irresolute and pitiful voice.::16/6/1913
Fancy Gap::740801.3290883121::“From what I’ve heard,” Pierre, blushing, again mixed into the conversation, “almost all the nobility have already gone over to Bonaparte’s side.”::6/11/1987
Burbank::295420.0835340767::“Yes, I was stupid, I still believed in people, and loved them, and sacrificed myself. But only those who are mean and vile succeed. I know whose intrigue this is.”::20/6/1950
Greeley::652749.0123432323::Pierre smiled, but it was clear from his smile that he realized it was not the anecdote about Sergei Kuzmich that interested Prince Vassily just then; and Prince Vassily realized that Pierre realized it. Prince Vassily suddenly burbled something and left. To Pierre it looked as if even Prince Vassily was embarrassed. The sight of this worldly old man’s embarrassment touched Pierre; he glanced at H&#233;l&#232;ne—she, too, seemed embarrassed, and her glance said: “Well, it’s your own fault.”::14/12/2010
San Mateo::678468.7612907707::The Englishman nodded his head, in no way making clear whether he did or did not accept this new bet. Anatole did not let go of the Englishman, and though he had nodded to show he had understood everything, Anatole translated Dolokhov’s words into English for him. A young, lean boy, a life-hussar, who had gambled away everything that evening, climbed up on the window, stuck his head out, and looked down.::20/12/1804
Schuyler::654396.6994493976::“Mon p&#232;re—Andr&#233;?”  said the graceless, awkward princess, with such an inexpressible loveliness of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father could not endure her gaze and, sobbing, turned away.::3/8/1914
El Cajon::121158.7017084903::“Prince Auersperg is standing on this side, our side, and defending us; I suppose he’s defending us very poorly, but still he’s defending us. But Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has not yet been taken and, I hope, will not be taken, because it’s mined and there’s an order to blow it up. Otherwise we’d have been in the mountains of Bohemia long ago, and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires.”::12/8/1816
Penhook::707988.4153042914::“Well, what now!” he said crossly and, having listened to the verbal orders from his father and taking the envelopes and his father’s letter, he went back to the nursery.::25/11/1919
Mollusk::764720.0223522412::“This is the same room, I’ve been told, in which the emperor Alexander lived. Strange, isn’t it, General?” he said, obviously not doubting that this remark could be anything but pleasing to his interlocutor, as it proved his, Napoleon’s, superiority to Alexander.::6/12/1810
Toga::785346.5120723869::“Mais, mon prince,”  said Anna Mikhailovna, “give him a moment’s rest after such a great sacrament. Here, Pierre, tell us your opinion,” she turned to the young man who, coming up close to them, looked with astonishment at the princess’s spiteful face, which had lost all decency, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince Vassily.::12/4/1810
Laurel Park::882874.3341236096::“Why can’t it be both together?” she thought in moments of total darkening. “Only then would I be perfectly happy, but now I must make a choice, and I can’t be happy without either of them. The thing is,” she thought, “that it’s equally impossible to tell Prince Andrei what has happened or to conceal it. While with this one  nothing’s spoiled. But can I really part forever with the happiness of loving Prince Andrei, which I’ve lived with for so long?”::18/10/1897
Bayside::700373.1747796317::“The prince is not entirely well—la bile et le transport au cerveau. Tranquillisez-vous, je repasserai demain,” †360 said M&#233;tivier, and, putting his finger to his lips, he hurriedly left.::12/6/1821
Lignum::761817.7843635237::“Adieu, Andr&#233;! Rappelez-vous que les malheurs viennent de Dieu, et que les hommes ne sont jamais coupables” *416 were the last words he heard from his sister as he was taking leave of her.::22/3/1982
Rialto::834429.8296223518::“Of course, we nearly ran into each other,” said the staff officer on duty, smiling pleasantly at Bolkonsky.::8/6/1921
Davenport::17003.961692271474::“Anyhow, I can’t stand it,” said Ilyin, noticing that Rostov did not like Zdrzhinsky’s conversation. “My socks, and my shirt, and under me it’s all soaked. I’ll go and find some shelter. The rain seems to be letting up.” Ilyin left, and Zdrzhinsky rode away.::24/3/1932
Tysons::98066.93842243419::Prince Vassily frowned, his mouth twisted to one side, his cheeks twitched with an unpleasant, coarse expression peculiar to him; he roused himself, got up, threw his head back, and with a resolute stride walked past the ladies into the small drawing room. He strode quickly, joyfully up to Pierre. The prince’s expression was so extraordinarily joyful that Pierre stood up, frightened, when he saw him.::9/5/1807
Mappsburg::415039.99892299506::The under-officer, frowning and muttering some abuse, thrust his horse’s breast towards Balashov, took hold of his saber, and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking him if he was deaf and had not heard what he was told. Balashov gave his name. The under-officer sent a soldier for an officer.::9/10/1809
League City::681888.4624813359::“No, dear heart,” spoke a pleasant voice, which seemed familiar to Prince Andrei, “I say that if it were possible to know what there will be after death, none of us would be afraid of death. That’s so, dear heart.”::4/2/1946
Midlothian::923644.5991891238::He spoke so quickly that half the words remained unfinished, but his son was used to understanding him. He led his son to the desk, opened the lid, pulled out a drawer, and took from it a notebook filled with his bold, tall, compact handwriting.::22/9/2002
Calverton::160131.17533786414::“What’s with you?” Rostov shouted, looking at him with rapturously spiteful eyes. “Don’t you hear: to the health of the sovereign emperor!” Pierre sighed, rose obediently, drank his glass, and, waiting for everyone to sit down, turned to Rostov with his kindly smile.::16/1/1930
Fulks Run::17353.17618342258::Though Nikolai Rostov, keeping firmly to his intention, went on serving in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little money, the way of life at Otradnoe was such, and Mitenka in particular so conducted business, that the debts mounted irresistibly every year. The only help the old count could evidently envisage was government service, and he went to Petersburg to seek a post; to seek a post and at the same time, as he said, to amuse the girls for the last time.::1/6/1817
Amelia Court House::319765.6306339955::“Know one thing, Masha, I cannot, have not, and never will reproach my wife  for anything, nor can I reproach myself for anything in relation to her; and that will always be so, whatever circumstances I find myself in. But if you want to know the truth…if you want to know whether I’m happy? No. Is she happy? No. Why is that? I don’t know…”::25/8/1816
Davie::261273.7149222011::Prince Andrei closed his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who had not taken his joyful, friendly eyes off Prince Andrei since he entered the drawing room, went up to him and took his arm. Prince Andrei, without turning around, wrinkled his face into a grimace, expressing vexation at whoever had taken his arm, but, seeing Pierre’s smiling face, suddenly smiled an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.::9/10/1855
Konnarock::964078.4428578583::“The predilection which, more than all others, made you vacillate on the path of virtue,” said the Mason.::4/1/1985
Las Cruces::942718.4293248104::“What’s he talking about?” thought Prince Andrei. “Ah, the spring, probably,” he thought, looking about. “So it is, everything’s green already…so quickly! Birches, and bird cherry, and alders already beginning…But no sign of oaks. Ah, there’s one.”::11/3/1858
Crockett::922951.8421103742::“In purifying and setting to rights our members, we try, thirdly, to set to rights the whole human race, offering it, through our members, an example of piety and virtue, and thereby trying with all our might to oppose the evil that reigns in the world. Think it over, and I will come to you again,” he said and left the room.::17/7/2015
Buckingham::355127.2545187518::“Or are you afraid to play with me?” Dolokhov said now, as if guessing Rostov’s thought, and he smiled. Behind his smile, Rostov saw in him that mood he had been in during the dinner at the club and generally at those times when, bored with everyday life, Dolokhov felt the necessity of getting out of it by some strange, most often cruel, act.::12/12/1901
South Bend::126639.50407321355::“Well, and now good-bye!” He gave his son his hand to kiss and embraced him. “Remember one thing, Prince Andrei: if you’re killed, I, your old father, will be pained…” He unexpectedly fell silent and suddenly went on in a shrill voice: “But if I learn that you have not behaved like Nikolai Bolkonsky’s son, I will be ashamed!” he shrieked.::12/12/1996
Broadlands::522922.283098992::“Ah, don’t speak to me! Last winter she wormed her way in here and told the count a whole heap of such vile, such nasty things about us all, especially Sophie—I can’t repeat it—that the count became ill and didn’t want to see us for two weeks. I know it was then that he wrote that nasty, loathsome document; but I thought the document meant nothing.”::11/3/1973
Vista::997358.7963372667::“Yakov! Let’s have a bottle, Yakov!” shouted the host himself, a tall, handsome man, who was standing in the midst of the crowd in nothing but a fine shirt open on his chest. “Wait, gentlemen. Here’s Petrusha, my dear friend,” he turned to Pierre.::4/7/1885
Apple Grove::866326.3815797656::When she said this to him, he made no reply, but only bowed and once more showed everyone his smile, which said nothing except perhaps this: “Opinions are opinions, but you see what a good and nice fellow I am.” And everyone, including Anna Pavlovna, involuntarily felt it.::12/3/1929
Susan::569682.18140955::Tikhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew his master’s train of thought. He guessed that he was being asked about Prince Vassily and his son.::16/7/2013
Free Union::79803.82911144868::“So you won’t go on? And I had a nice card ready.” As if he was most interested in the amusement of the game itself.::13/9/1876
Keokee::92626.42588235837::“Non, ce n’est rien, je voulais dire seulement…”  (He intended to repeat a joke that he had heard in Vienna and that he had been trying to put in all evening.) “Je voulais dire seulement que nous avons tort de faire la guerre ‘pour le Roi de Prusse.’” ‡305 12::15/7/1835
Renton::792520.5164802569::Dolokhov slowly straightened his bent leg and looked the general directly in the face with his light and insolent gaze.::13/12/1828
Fairfax Station::285191.61876941565::The whole aim of his speech now was obviously to exalt himself and insult Alexander, that is, to do the thing he had least wanted to do at the beginning of the meeting.::21/4/1829
Bensley::728950.0885133771::Having returned to the regiment and told the commander about the state of Denisov’s case, Rostov rode on to Tilsit with the letter to the sovereign.::14/10/1922
Lebanon Church::590817.4810277298::And Natasha, spreading her big mouth and looking perfectly ugly, started howling like a baby, not knowing the reason why, only because Sonya was crying. Sonya wanted to raise her head and reply, but could not and buried herself still more. Natasha wept, sitting on the blue featherbed and embracing her friend. Gathering her forces, Sonya sat up and began wiping away her tears and telling her story.::3/9/1833
Brumley Gap::257340.2281881748::“And where’s the fur coat?” said Dolokhov. “Hey, Ignashka! Go to Matryona Matveevna, ask for her sable coat. I’ve heard how people elope,” Dolokhov said, winking. “She’ll come running out more dead than alive, in whatever she had on at home; if there’s any dawdling—there’ll be tears, and papa and mama, and she’ll get cold and go back. You must wrap her in a fur coat at once and carry her to the sleigh.”::9/12/1912
Patrick Springs::704705.4470912076::“All is lost?” he repeated. “If I were not I, but the handsomest, brightest, and best man in the world, and I was free, I would go on my knees this minute and ask for your hand and your love.”::9/8/2018
San Angelo::441683.8018121444::“Well, then I’ll tell you now. You know that Sonya’s my friend, such a friend that I’d burn my arm for her. Look here.” She pushed up her muslin sleeve and showed a red mark on her long, thin, and delicate arm, below the shoulder but far above the elbow (where it is covered even by ball gowns).::2/10/1974
Spencer::238721.01679089264::Not letting go of the abb&#233; and Pierre, Anna Pavlovna, the better to keep an eye on them, joined them to the general circle.::5/1/1934
Gressitt::292136.3978458853::“And what’s going on with us, brother! Terrible! I confess, brother, we laughed at Mack, and yet it’s going much worse for us,” said Nesvitsky. “But sit down, eat something.”::12/3/1954
Commonwealth::278944.5832949163::“Rotten! but that’s not the point. My friend,” said Dolokhov in a halting voice, “where are we? We’re in Moscow, I know. Never mind me, but I’ve killed her, killed…She won’t survive it. She won’t survive…”::14/8/1838
Oak Level::64551.96552200082::Having finished doing her hair, Natasha, in a short petticoat, her ball slippers showing from under it, and wearing her mother’s bed jacket, ran up to Sonya, looked her over, and then ran to her mother. She turned her mother’s head, pinned on the toque, and, quickly kissing her gray hair, again ran to the maids who were taking up her skirt.::18/9/1809
Adwolf::320725.77141126466::Late at night, the Rostovs’ four vehicles drove into Marya Dmitrievna’s courtyard on Old Konyushennaya Street. Marya Dmitrievna lived alone. Her daughter was already married. Her sons were all in the army.::24/5/1830
Cana::587263.6795557913::“Just a moment. Hey, you there!” he cried in a voice such as people use who are sure that those they call will come rushing to them. “Send Mitenka to me!”::9/5/1936
Haynesville::813850.2978405828::The room was in semi-darkness, only two icon lamps burned before the icons, and there was a good smell of incense and flowers. The whole room was filled with small furniture: little chiffoniers, cupboards, tables. Behind a screen the white covers of a high featherbed could be seen. A little dog barked.::15/11/1953
Roanoke::961010.7950749808::“Ah, what a Daniel Cooper!” said Marya Dmitrievna, letting out a long, deep breath and pushing up her sleeves.::24/6/1867
Kenosha::420090.50132114044::“Yes, we should ride over…together, shall we?” Nikolai replied, looking at Yerza and at his uncle’s red Rugai, two rivals with whom he had never yet had his dogs compete. “And what if they pull my Milka off its ears?” he thought, heading for the hare alongside his uncle and Ilagin.::15/4/1815
Charles City::282645.1101386621::“I am not petitioning for anything, but the sovereign emperor has deigned to pass on to Your Excellency the memorandum I submitted…”::1/9/1968
Rose Hill Farms::186444.9858281204::“Marie,” she said, leaving the embroidery frame and throwing herself backwards, “give me your hand.” She took the princess’s hand and placed it on her belly.::3/2/1862
Tuscaloosa::811359.153010753::“Well, what do you want, then? You’re all in love these days. Well, if you’re in love, marry him,” the countess said, laughing crossly. “God help you!”::8/5/1995
Savageville::883681.4851813614::On the third day of Christmas, Nikolai dined at home, which had rarely happened with him recently. This was an official farewell dinner, because he and Denisov would be leaving for their regiment after Epiphany.18 There were some twenty guests at dinner, Dolokhov and Denisov among them.::16/2/1844
Emory::637941.9670065292::“Well, Captain Tushin, aren’t you ashamed?” the staff officer went on. “It would seem that you, as an artillerist, ought to set an example, and here you are bootless. They’ll sound the alarm, and a fine one you’ll be with no boots on.” (The staff officer smiled.) “Kindly go back to your posts, gentlemen—all, all of you,” he added in a superior’s tone.::3/8/1987
Cartersville::712686.9859576868::Following the letter, one of the brother Masons he respected less than the others broke in upon Pierre’s solitude and, turning the conversation to Pierre’s marital relations, in the guise of brotherly advice came out with the thought that his severity towards his wife was unjust, and that Pierre was departing from the primary rules of Masonry in not forgiving the penitent.::25/4/1919
Apple Mountain Lake::45805.94852515541::“General, I am duty-bound to obey orders, but I am not duty-bound to put up with…” Dolokhov said hastily.::10/10/1874
Allen::581005.7815349406::Napoleon met Balashov with a cheerful and benign air. Not only was there no expression in him of embarrassment or self-reproach for his morning’s outburst, but, on the contrary, he tried to encourage Balashov. Clearly it was Napoleon’s long-standing conviction that the possibility of mistakes did not exist for him, and to his mind everything he did was good, not because it agreed with any notion of what was good and bad, but because he  did it.::15/12/1830
Barracks::352146.51728377875::“And, finally, as a sign of openheartedness, I ask you to reveal to me your main predilection,” he said.::10/8/1849
Erie::646028.8528128349::“Supper, time for supper! The Gypsies are here!” Indeed, some dark-haired men and women, saying something with a Gypsy accent, were already coming in from the cold. Nikolai knew it was all over, but he said in an indifferent voice:::1/1/1942
Sparks::998323.2706722014::Rostov, standing in the front ranks of Kutuzov’s army, which the sovereign rode up to first, had the same feeling that was experienced by every man in that army—a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud awareness of strength, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this solemnity.::9/3/1858
Vacaville::993388.6432531282::One day she came to the countess, was about to say something to her, and suddenly began to cry. Her tears were the tears of an offended child who does not know why it is being punished.::18/5/1994
Centreville::140186.35920419343::“Oh, so right! I recently quarreled with mama about it. Mama said she was trying to snare you. How could she say that! I nearly had a fight with mama. And I’ll never let anybody say or think anything bad about her, because there’s nothing but good in her.”::18/2/1843
Sherando::454193.8856946353::The girl smiled and took it. Like everyone else on the bridge, Nesvitsky never took his eyes off the women until they had passed. Once they had passed, there again came the same soldiers, with the same talk, and finally everybody stopped. As often happens, the horses pulling the company cart balked at the exit from the bridge, and the whole crowd had to wait.::22/12/1898
Albany::537288.0266164389::And the conversation again became concentrated, the ladies’ at their end of the table, the men’s at theirs.::5/8/1989
Wicomico Church::341016.813656678::“Quite different and yet the same,” thought Nikolai, looking at her face all lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his hands under the coat that covered her head, embraced her, pressed her to him, and kissed her on the lips, which had a mustache on them and smelled of burnt cork. Sonya kissed him right in the middle of the lips and, freeing her small hands, put them to his cheeks.::9/1/1895
Short Pump::259064.9756985517::“Christ be with you!” Kutuzov repeated and went to his carriage. “Get in with me,” he said to Bolkonsky.::3/12/2011
Fairview Beach::276566.4685299555::“No, wait, Pierre. The princess is so good that she will not want to deprive me of the pleasure of spending an evening with you.”::6/4/1960
Lunenburg::691552.2777126571::“Well, come on then. I only stopped to ask Denisov about yesterday’s orders. Did you receive them, Denisov?”::1/5/1854
Mustoe::86577.1255248714::“Crew, to your pieces!” the officer commanded, and in a minute the artillery crew ran merrily from their campfires and loaded up.::2/4/1825
Beaverton::606120.0836587575::“But they’re the same as myself, they’re not others,” said Prince Andrei, “and others, one’s ‘neighbors,’ le prochain,  as you and Princess Marya call them, are the chief source of error and evil. Le prochain —that’s those Kievan peasants of yours, to whom you want to do good.”::17/2/1995
Newington::353080.16216374503::“Well, dear heart,” he said, “I wanted to tell you yesterday, and I’ve come to tell you today. I’ve never experienced anything like it. I’m in love, my friend.”::4/11/1902
Greenbush::458479.953434881::“About life, about man’s purpose. It can’t be. I thought the same, and do you know what saved me? Masonry. No, don’t smile. Masonry is not a religious, not a ritual sect, as I also thought, Masonry is the best, the only expression of the best, the eternal sides of mankind.” And he began to explain Masonry to Prince Andrei as he understood it.::10/6/1932
Compton::445524.9785571074::“Yes, mais ce n’est pas comme vous l’entendez, ”*316 Prince Andrei went on. “I never wished, nor do I wish now, any good to that scoundrel of a protocolist, who stole some boots from the militiamen; I’d even be very pleased to see him hanged, but I pity my father—that is, again, myself.”::11/6/1897
Orem::621475.3137189419::“Ah, what a Daniel Cooper!” said Marya Dmitrievna, letting out a long, deep breath and pushing up her sleeves.::9/1/1926
Gargatha::899511.9793351708::“Spring, and love, and happiness!” the oak seemed to say. “And how is it you’re not bored with the same stupid, senseless deception! Always the same, and always a deception! There is no spring, no sun, no happiness. Look, there sit those smothered, dead fir trees, always the same; look at me spreading my broken, flayed fingers wherever they grow—from my back, from my sides. As they’ve grown, so I stand, and I don’t believe in your hopes and deceptions.”::16/1/1818
Massanutten::731739.214361208::“Ah, what a swine I am, though, that I didn’t write even once and frightened them so. Ah, what a swine I am!” he repeated, suddenly blushing. “So send Gavrilo for wine! Let’s have a drink!” he said.::1/4/1875
Rustburg::698250.4100636338::“That’s the veritable truth,” he said. “And I regret that I went to see him and took her,” said the old count.::12/1/1893
Providence Forge::822342.791299933::“In my view,” he said, turning to Rostov, “he ought simply to beg the sovereign for mercy. They say there will be lots of rewards now, and surely he’d be forgiven…”::11/4/1871
Flint::27768.0591563928::“Mama! what’s for dessert?” Natasha’s little voice rang out still more resolutely, without faltering.::17/12/1998
Lee Mont::417441.80045455194::“If he, however, is senior to mine in the ranking,” the German hussar colonel said, turning red and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, “leave him to do as he wants. I my hussars cannot sacrifice. Bugler! Sound the retreat!”::14/5/1869
Federal Way::280459.75751106144::The red blotches stood out still more on Princess Marya’s forehead, neck, and cheeks. She wanted to say something, but could not bring it out. Her brother had guessed right: the little princess had wept after dinner, had said she had a foreboding of a bad delivery, was afraid of it, and had complained about her life, her father-in-law, and her husband. After her tears, she had fallen asleep. Prince Andrei felt sorry for his sister.::8/9/1911
Mission Viejo::301988.6081165079::“Wine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Hot temper? Anger? Women?” he went through his vices, weighing them mentally, and did not know which to give preference to.::18/12/1986
Wilderness::462143.6847825255::Pierre, with a meek smile of pity and regret, his legs and arms spread helplessly, his broad chest exposed, stood before Dolokhov and looked at him sorrowfully. Denisov, Rostov, and Nesvitsky closed their eyes. The shot and Dolokhov’s angry cry came simultaneously.::2/9/1876
Allisonia::344433.6142206096::The unpleasant impression, like the remains of fog in a clear sky, passed over the emperor’s young and happy face and disappeared. He was somewhat thinner that day, after his illness, than on the field of Olm&#252;tz, where Bolkonsky had seen him for the first time abroad, but there was the same enchanting combination of majesty and mildness in his beautiful gray eyes, and the fine lips had the same possibility of various expressions, with a prevalent expression of good-natured, innocent youth.::1/1/1833
Rose Hill::371699.4776049614::Carousers, those male Magdalenes, have a hidden sense of awareness of their innocence, just as female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope of forgiveness. “Everything will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and everything will be forgiven him, for he had much fun.”11::14/5/1820
Spokane Valley::832366.5988117895::“So you saw him?” asked Prince Andrei. “Well, what is Bonaparte like? What impression did he make on you?”::22/7/1859
Mappsville::740503.5915835192::Prince Andrei did not see how or by whom it was put back on him, but suddenly, on his chest over the uniform, a little icon on a fine gold chain turned up.::20/7/1837
Mountain Road::532219.0278001133::“Yes, yes, all right,” the count said quickly, “only, excuse me, my friend, I’ll give you twenty thousand, and a promissory note for eighty thousand besides. So there, kiss me.”::24/12/1909
Boca Raton::801040.9574342774::“He’s here now, tell him…to for…forgive me.” She stopped and began to breathe still more rapidly, but she did not cry.::19/5/1962
Lees Summit::682039.5884449795::“Mama, Bolkonsky’s here!” she said. “Mama, it’s terrible, it’s unbearable! I don’t want…to suffer! What am I to do?…”::23/7/1869
Boston::996999.90843295::Having learned at the last posting station that Prince Andrei was not at Bald Hills, but at his newly allotted estate, Pierre went to him there.::6/12/1936
Elliston::815022.7126773318::“If he’s a noble man, then he should either declare his intentions or stop seeing you; and if you don’t want to do it, I’ll do it; I’ll write to him and tell papa ,” Sonya said resolutely.::16/2/1941
Rio Rancho::716734.4870679599::But while Nikolai was working out all these questions within himself, still without giving himself a clear accounting of what confused him so much, the wheel of fortune of military service, as often happens, turned in his favor. After the Ostrovna action he was promoted, was given a battalion of hussars, and whenever a brave officer was called for, the mission was given to him.::24/11/1920
Montvale::782526.1743123211::Rostov was very happy in the love that was shown him, but the first moment of their meeting had been so blissful that his present happiness seemed too little to him, and he kept waiting for more, and more, and more.::14/8/1967
Mount Hermon::531270.2893061341::“Devil knows about them! He’s beaten everybody! Perish them all!” answers came in Russian, German, and Czech from the crowds of fleeing men who, like himself, did not understand what was going on there.::4/4/1922
Brockton::42390.24996015073::“Ah, it’s you,” said Pierre, with a distracted and displeased air. “And here I am working,” he said, pointing to his notebook with that look of escaping from life’s adversities with which unhappy people look at their work.::23/9/1982
Meridian::922489.5738598858::Pierre took the bundle of papers. Prince Andrei, as if trying to remember if he had something else to say, or waiting for Pierre to say something, stood looking at him with fixed eyes.::25/11/1898
South Gate::462234.98314755975::Having cleared the road, Denisov stopped at the entrance to the bridge. Casually holding back his stallion, who was straining towards his fellows and stamping his foot, he looked at the squadron that was moving towards him. The transparent sounds of hooves rang out on the planks of the bridge, as if several horses were galloping, and the squadron, with officers in front, four men abreast, stretched across the bridge and began to come out on the other side.::10/10/1949
Lawrence::819583.628308916::“Allez, mon ami,” *285 said Princess Marya. Prince Andrei went to his wife again and sat in the next room waiting. Some woman came out of the room with a frightened face and became embarrassed on seeing Prince Andrei. He covered his face with his hands and sat that way for several minutes. Pitiful, helplessly animal moans came from behind the door. Prince Andrei got up, went to the door, and wanted to open it. Someone was holding the door.::10/10/2018
Greenbackville::51309.63974704472::“Well, you haven’t told me anything new.” And the old man muttered pensively to himself in a quick patter: “Dieu sait quand reviendra.  Go to the dining room.”::4/2/1874
Zuni::43182.482773801436::Rostov did not think of what the call for a stretcher meant; he ran on, trying only to be ahead of everyone else; but just by the bridge, not looking under his feet, he got into the slimy, trampled mud, stumbled, and fell on his hands. Others ran past him.::22/8/1876
Manakin::288326.5874774776::“Another Izmail comrade,”2 he said. “A brave officer! Are you pleased with him?” Kutuzov asked the regimental commander.::10/3/1963
McDowell::799444.7118934429::“I loved you all and did nothing bad to anybody, and what have you done to me? Ah, what have you done to me?” said her lovely, pitiful, dead face. In the corner, something small and red snorted and squealed in Marya Bogdanovna’s white, trembling hands.::20/9/1946
San Marcos::941715.9702113968::The princess was about to get up, but the prince held her by the arm. The princess had the air of someone who has suddenly become disappointed in the whole human race; she looked spitefully at her interlocutor.::19/9/1978
Hayfield::776534.7825146285::The countess’s health still did not improve; but it was no longer possible to put off the trip to Moscow. A dowry had to be prepared, the house had to be sold, and, besides, Prince Andrei was first expected in Moscow, where Prince Nikolai Andreich was spending that winter, and Natasha was sure that he had already arrived.::14/5/1946
Portsmouth::31868.883385931746::COUNT NIKOL&#193;I ILY&#205;CH (Nik&#243;lushka, Nik&#243;lenka, Nikol&#225;shka, K&#243;lya, Nicolas, Coco), their elder son::18/4/2015
Jetersville::846877.9449047558::Anatole quite soon abandoned his wife and, for the money he promised to send to his father-in-law, reserved for himself the right to pass himself off as a bachelor.::9/10/1967
Countryside::487467.1074133755::The little princess was much changed. She was rather more bad- than good-looking now. Her cheeks sagged, her lip rose up, her eyes were drawn down.::21/7/2014
New Bedford::928579.8095586399::“Hurry up, hurry up,” thought Rostov, sensing that the time had come at last to experience the delight of an attack, of which he had heard so much from his hussar comrades.::8/2/1968
Woolwine::740558.177259002::“Ah! The warrior! So you want to defeat Bonaparte?” said the old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the braided queue, which was in Tikhon’s hands, would let him. “At least give him a good drubbing, or pretty soon he’ll be writing us down, too, as his subjects. Greetings!” And he offered his cheek.::23/8/2004
Eagle Rock::366730.35828655266::Prince Andrei did not see how or by whom it was put back on him, but suddenly, on his chest over the uniform, a little icon on a fine gold chain turned up.::3/3/2015
Crystal Hill::657155.1067532666::All Moscow society, from old women to children, received Pierre like a long-awaited guest, whose place was always kept ready and vacant. For Moscow society, Pierre was the most dear, kind, intelligent, merry, and magnanimous of eccentrics, absentminded and warm-hearted, a Russian squire of the old stamp. His purse was always empty, because it was open to everyone.::15/2/1932
Stonega::242650.13757370535::“Rotten luck,” he said, throwing down a purse with a few gold pieces. “Rostov, dear heart, count up what’s left and put it under the pillow,” he said and went out to the sergeant major.::8/5/1802
Edgerton::54981.82497536863::The third time the rhetor came back sooner and asked Pierre whether he was still firm in his intention and was determined to submit himself to everything that was demanded of him.::14/12/1964
Arrington::566722.4439314961::“I, too, want to become a Muscovite now,” said H&#233;l&#232;ne. “And you should be ashamed to bury such pearls in the country!”::10/9/1885
Carrollton::731437.3939470479::“Eh bien, g&#233;n&#233;ral, tout est &#224; la guerre, &#224; ce qu’il parait,” §400 he said as if regretting the circumstance, of which he could not judge.::22/11/1887
Gore::731633.2520975202::Natasha, pale, stern, was sitting next to Marya Dmitrievna, and her feverishly glittering, questioning gaze met Pierre just at the door. She did not smile, did not nod to him, she only looked at him fixedly, and her gaze asked him only this: was he a friend, or, like everybody else, an enemy in relation to Anatole? Pierre himself evidently did not exist for her.::2/1/2011
Acorn::798203.690781916::There was nothing bad or inappropriate in what they said, everything was witty and might have been funny; but that something which constitutes the salt of merriment was not only missing, but they did not even know it existed.::22/10/1808
Bastian::645827.8699670575::“But you know, Countess,” he said suddenly, addressing her like an old, long-standing acquaintance, “we’re organizing a costume carousel; you must take part in it: we’ll have great fun. Everybody’s getting together at the Arkharovs’. Please come, won’t you?” he said.::22/8/1891
Stafford::42131.85813105525::Natasha looked at Sonya with astonished eyes. Clearly, this question had presented itself to her for the first time, and she did not know how to answer it.::5/4/1804
Hanover::25936.936534841636::“The same hours, and the lathe, also mathematics, and my geometry lessons,” Princess Marya replied joyfully, as though her lessons in geometry were one of the most joyful impressions of her life.::4/9/1883
Woodlake::271835.646870611::“But what are you shouting for? Calm down,” said Rostov. “Here you’re bleeding again. Wait, your bandage should be changed.”::3/1/1882
Fort Mitchell::550053.0730349477::On Sunday morning, Marya Dmitrievna invited her guests to the liturgy at her parish of the Dormition on Mogiltsy.12::16/9/1891
Augusta Springs::218070.46857702083::The head steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre’s intentions; but he observed that, besides these transformations, it was generally necessary to take care of things, which were in a bad state.::16/12/1847
Yuma::47790.131546993965::“And what secrets can there be at your age between Natasha and Boris and between you two? It’s all silliness!”::3/9/1911
Metompkin::932092.6003640717::The third time the rhetor came back sooner and asked Pierre whether he was still firm in his intention and was determined to submit himself to everything that was demanded of him.::8/12/1920
Maurertown::532232.5808485057::“What’s evil for another person is wrong,” said Pierre, pleased to feel that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrei was becoming animated and was beginning to talk and wanted to speak out everything that had made him the way he was now.::22/8/1855
Lawton::374796.8221161575::“Well, aren’t you a fool!” shouted the prince, shoving the notebook away, but he got up at once, paced about, touched the princess’s hair with his hands, and sat down again.::24/9/2001
Yale::360055.8384940804::“Well, what is it tonight?” asked her mother, settling on the pillows and waiting until Natasha, having kicked her feet and turned over twice, lay next to her under the same blanket, her arms on top it, her expression serious.::24/3/1844
New Baltimore::353870.065983942::By five o’clock in the afternoon, the battle had been lost at all points. More than a hundred cannon had already been captured by the French.::10/5/1833
Syria::976569.915512471::“Can it be me, that ‘baby girl’ (as everybody said of me),” thought Natasha, “can it be that from this moment on I’m a wife,  equal to this strange, dear, intelligent man, whom even my father respects? Can it be true? Can it be true that now there is to be no more toying with life, that I’m grown up now, that responsibility is laid upon me now for my every deed and word? Ah, what was it he asked me?”::19/7/1970
Idylwood::244666.10805615262::Pierre lived at Prince Vassily Kuragin’s and took part in the dissolute life of his son Anatole, the same one they planned to marry to Prince Andrei’s sister in order to reform him.::11/10/1867
Roswell::395958.95415730245::“And I just didn’t recognize you,” he said. But Rostov could not be bothered, he was shouting “Hurrah!”::20/6/1975
Dearborn::197768.3571087949::“No, you know, I don’t believe we were in animals,” Natasha said in the same whisper, though the music had stopped. “I know for certain that we were angels somewhere, and visited here, and so we remember everything…”::23/12/1852
Livonia::949884.5654300182::“Why is it hard to imagine eternity?” asked Natasha. “There will be today, there will be tomorrow, there will be always, and there was yesterday, and there was the day before…”::5/11/1819
Mouth of Wilson::462056.9166027456::“I know, dear, good princess,” said Anna Mikhailovna, seizing the portfolio with her hand and so firmly that it was clear she would not soon let go of it. “Dear princess, I beg you, I beseech you, have pity on him. Je vous en conjure… *140::15/2/1957
Yakima::86747.96988829182::Between each kind of troops was a sort of street. The three parts of this army could be clearly distinguished from each other: Kutuzov’s fighting force (in which the Pavlogradsky regiment stood on the right flank in the front line), the infantry and guards regiments come from Russia, and the Austrian troops. But they all stood in one line, under one command, and in the same order.::4/10/1803
Williamsville::336921.0377177256::“The execution of the duc d’Enghien,” said Pierre, “was a necessity of state; and I precisely see greatness of soul in the fact that Napoleon was not afraid to take upon himself alone the responsibility for this act.”::9/6/1928
Whitesville::94646.62375854792::As he was saying this, he got up, went over to his sister, and, bending down, kissed her on the forehead. His fine eyes shone with an intelligent and kindly, unhabitual light, but he was looking not at his sister but into the darkness of the open doorway, over her head.::20/12/1982
Catlett::393446.2432441603::“Si vous vous permettez dans mon salon…” *386 H&#233;l&#232;ne said in a whisper; but Pierre left the room without answering her.::14/10/1999
Ebony::822454.0471589743::“Wait a minute, my dear boy, listen to me,” the staff captain interrupted in his bass voice, calmly stroking his long mustache. “You tell the regimental commander, in front of other officers, that an officer has stolen…”::20/10/1809
Sunrise::317080.9872769782::Danilo rode silently, holding an unsheathed dagger in his left hand, and threshing the taut flanks of his brown horse with his whip as if it was a flail.::5/7/1963
Bassett::442998.1474517103::The old prince was also awake. Tikhon, through his sleep, heard him pacing about angrily and snorting through his nose. It seemed to the old prince that he was offended for his daughter. The offense was most painful because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he loved more than himself. He told himself that he would think over the whole matter again and find what was fair and ought to be done, but instead he only irritated himself more.::1/5/1822
Hesperia::768315.4379973558::After another five days, the young prince Nikolai Andreich was baptized. The foster mother held the swaddling clothes up with her chin, while the priest anointed the boy’s wrinkled red palms and feet with a goose feather.::3/1/1937
Arlington::933159.4485819419::“Tell the prince that labor has begun,” said Marya Bogdanovna, glancing significantly at the messenger. Tikhon went and told him.::6/7/1951
Quincy::409508.52869532193::“Je vous aime!”  he said, having remembered what needed to be said on these occasions; but the words sounded so meager that he felt ashamed of himself.::20/2/1876
New River::322504.0655854574::History, that is, the unconscious, swarmlike life of mankind, uses every moment of a king’s life as an instrument for its purposes.::17/9/1805
Twin Lakes::680239.1208675035::“Non, non, de gr&#226;ce…Vous &#234;tes Mlle Bourienne, je vous connais d&#233;j&#224; par l’amiti&#233; que vous porte ma belle-soeur,”  said the princess, kissing her. “Elle ne nous attend pas!” §157::15/3/1979
Stanleytown::551672.7561626587::“Do you remember me?” Boris said quietly, with a pleasant smile. “I’ve come to see the count with my mother, but it seems he’s not entirely well.”::25/10/1865
Longmont::685701.545320085::Natasha had made a strong impression on Kuragin. Over supper after the theater, in the manner of a connoisseur, he analyzed for Dolokhov the merits of her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair, and announced his decision to dangle after her a bit. What the result of this courtship might be, Anatole could not reflect upon or know, as he never knew what the result of any of his actions would be.::6/9/1822
Heathsville::382909.1425674086::“Mama, darling, it’s not at all because of…my poor, dear heart,” she was saying to her mother, who, feeling herself on the verge of a breakup, looked at her son with horror, but, being stubborn and carried away by the struggle, would not and could not give in.::3/5/1827
Carson::470878.74245945783::Natasha stood up and curtsied to the magnificent countess. Natasha was so pleased to be praised by this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure.::8/12/1821
Amonate::674186.9661945127::“Yerzinka! Dearie!” wailed Ilagin in a voice not his own. Yerza did not heed his prayer. At the very moment she was expected to seize the hare, he swerved and flew out to the boundary between the green fields and the stubble. Again Yerza and Milka, like a team of horses, straightened up and sped after the hare; it was easier for him to run along the boundary, and dogs could not close in on him so quickly.::19/5/1933
Plantation::920698.8754491357::Having read the letter, Natasha sat down at the desk to write a reply. “Ch&#232;re Princesse!”  she wrote quickly and mechanically, and stopped. What could she write after all that had happened yesterday? “Yes, yes, all that was, and now it’s all different,” she thought, sitting over the started letter. “Must I refuse him? Must I really? It’s terrible!…” And, so as not to think those dreadful thoughts, she went to Sonya and began sorting out patterns with her.::14/7/1825
Lynn::841492.318467363::Five times already, with other people, Prince Andrei had heard exactly the same phrase about the countess Zubov and the same laughter from his wife. He quietly went into the room. The princess, round, rosy, with her work in her hands, was sitting in an armchair and talking non-stop, telling over her Petersburg memories and even phrases. Prince Andrei went to her, stroked her head, and asked whether she had rested from the journey. She made a reply and went on with the same talk.::8/6/1928
Vansant::130291.11514626812::“I shall never dare to say that I know the truth,” said the Mason, amazing Pierre more and more with his definite and firm speech. “No one can attain to the truth by himself; only stone by stone, with the participation of all, over millions of generations, from our forefather Adam down to our time, is the temple being built which is to become a worthy dwelling place for the great God,” said the Mason, and he closed his eyes.::23/10/1985
Santa Monica::746612.4775194542::After several recitations, Mlle George left, and Countess Bezukhov invited the company to the reception room.::20/12/1831
Lake Monticello::109239.16434954661::“&#192; celui qui s’est le plus vaillamment conduit dans cette derni&#232;re guerre,” †334 Napoleon added, rapping out every syllable with a calm and assurance that Rostov found outrageous, and looking over the ranks of Russian soldiers standing at attention before him, still presenting arms and looking fixedly at the face of their emperor.::22/8/1880
Villa Heights::773575.7884499229::But two weeks after his departure, just as unexpectedly for those around her, she recovered from her moral illness and became the same as before, only with a changed moral physiognomy, as children get up with a different face after a prolonged illness.::12/12/1902
West Springfield::74119.84368212077::“Revolution and regicide a great thing?…After that…wouldn’t you like to move to that table?” Anna Pavlovna repeated.::20/11/1830
Santa Barbara::733933.2331666251::The countess was upset by her friend’s woes and humiliating poverty, and was therefore out of sorts, which always expressed itself in her calling the maid “dear” and “miss.”::15/4/1839
Abbott::292740.40627108613::“That I will not promise you. You know how besieged Kutuzov has been since he was appointed commander in chief.13 He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies are conspiring to send their children to be his adjutants.”::17/10/1868
Miami Beach::535657.1973988868::But most of all, in all circles, they talked about the sovereign Alexander, repeating his every word and movement and admiring him.::3/4/1884
Wallace::671756.625879076::“Catiche a fait donner du th&#233; dans le petit salon,”  Prince Vassily said to Anna Mikhailovna. “Allez, ma pauvre  Anna Mikhailovna, prenez quelque chose, autrement vous ne suffirez pas .” †137::21/7/1867
Bull Run Mountain Estates::260778.03900747243::“Quelle d&#233;licieuse personne, que cette petite princesse!” **32 Prince Vassily said to Anna Pavlovna.::17/3/1841
Falling Spring::893285.8151798061::“Permission? Permission? You young people are always that way,” said the regimental commander, cooling down a little. “Permission? Say something to you, and you…” The regimental commander paused. “Say something to you, and you…What?” he said, getting irritated again. “Kindly dress your men properly…”::1/2/1951
Chase Crossing::762266.0505918274::“Why are you saying this?” Natasha interrupted him. “You know I’ve loved you from the very day you first came to Otradnoe,” she said, firmly convinced that she was speaking the truth.::8/10/1882
Redding::172572.89157964496::The conversation ceased for a moment; the old general cleared his throat to draw attention to himself.::8/12/1961
Benns Church::829256.4767125772::“A real picture! Like the other day when we chased a fox from the Zavarzinsky thicket. The master went hurtling to cut it off from the forest, something fearsome—a thousand-rouble horse, but the rider’s priceless! Yes, a fine fellow like that is hard to find!”::16/4/1923
Cullen::344450.19067825965::“How beautiful! She yields nothing to Marya Antonovna.17 See how the men dangle after her, young and old. Both beautiful and intelligent. They say Prince——has lost his mind over her. But these two here, though they’re not beautiful, are still more surrounded.”::12/12/1979
Esmont::304344.3370971852::In October 1805 Russian troops were occupying villages and towns in the archduchy of Austria, and more new regiments kept arriving from Russia to be stationed by the fortress of Braunau, burdening the local inhabitants with their billeting. In Braunau the commander in chief, Kutuzov, had his headquarters.::14/4/1850
Chico::23625.80009766024::Again there appeared on all the cheerful faces of the men of the squadron that serious trait that had been there when they were under fire. Rostov, never taking his eyes away, kept looking at his enemy, the regimental commander, wishing to find on his face a confirmation of his surmises; but the colonel never once glanced at Rostov, but, as always at the front, looked stern and solemn. The command was heard.::15/1/1817
Seven Mile Ford::177724.82330735528::Opening the door to the reception room, Pierre saw Natasha sitting by the window with a thin, pale, and spiteful face. She glanced at him, frowned, and, with an expression of cold dignity, left the room.::5/12/1875
Brooke::88434.48501329731::Count Turenne led him into a large reception room, in which sat many generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish dignitaries, many of whom Balashov had seen at the court of the Russian emperor. Duroc said that the emperor Napoleon would receive the Russian general before his promenade.::19/10/1940
Achilles::324818.3682031656::Prince Andrei did not see how or by whom it was put back on him, but suddenly, on his chest over the uniform, a little icon on a fine gold chain turned up.::15/10/1845
Lewisetta::712590.5273119109::“You’ll never understand it,” she said, turning to Vera, “because you’ve never loved anybody, you have no heart, you’re just a Madame de Genlis” (this nickname, considered very offensive, had been given to Vera by Nikolai), “and your highest pleasure is to do unpleasant things to others. Go and flirt with Berg as much as you like,” she said quickly.::19/2/1874
Westminster::539223.9258867182::Just then the arrival of Count Bezukhov was announced. The two spouses exchanged self-satisfied smiles, each silently claiming the honor of this visit.::23/2/1909
Atkins::674683.2670999945::In the year twelve, when news of the war with Napoleon reached Bucharest (where Kutuzov had been staying for two months, spending the days and nights with his Wallachian woman), Prince Andrei asked Kutuzov to transfer him to the Western Army. Kutuzov, who by then was sick of Bolkonsky’s activity, which served as a reproach to his idleness, quite willingly let him go and gave him an errand to Barclay de Tolly.::1/6/1939
Greenville::111786.28278065727::The Englishman nodded his head, in no way making clear whether he did or did not accept this new bet. Anatole did not let go of the Englishman, and though he had nodded to show he had understood everything, Anatole translated Dolokhov’s words into English for him. A young, lean boy, a life-hussar, who had gambled away everything that evening, climbed up on the window, stuck his head out, and looked down.::7/6/1873
Nampa::68430.9346797598::Each man lives for himself, uses his freedom to achieve his personal goals, and feels with his whole being that right now he can or cannot do such-and-such an action; but as soon as he does it, this action, committed at a certain moment in time, becomes irreversible and makes itself the property of history, in which it has not a free but a predestined significance.::19/9/1992
Ladysmith::381022.39386878966::At the porch stood two troikas, held by two fine-looking coachmen. Balaga got up on the first troika and, raising his elbows high, unhurriedly sorted out the reins. Anatole and Dolokhov got in with him. Makarin, Khvostikov, and the valet got into the other troika.::13/11/2008
Whaleyville::563535.8532740575::In the middle of the way, Nikolai handed the horses over to the coachman, ran to Natasha’s sleigh for a moment, and stood on the fender.::14/10/1904
Edmond::692530.7959200788::“He’s pure gold, my Mitenka,” the count added, smiling, when the young man went out. “Nothing’s ever impossible. I can’t stand that. Everything’s possible.”::22/4/1922
Blue Ridge Shores::727316.5313101226::“I agree with you completely,” replied Nikolai, blushing all over, turning his plate and rearranging the glasses, and with such a determined and desperate air as though he was exposed right then to great danger. “I’m convinced that the Russians must either die or conquer,” he said, aware himself, as the others were, once the word had been spoken, that it was too rapturous and pompous for the present occasion and therefore awkward.::1/1/1868
Montclair::573219.0169931126::Prince Andrei kept glancing with a smile now at Pierre, now at the viscount, now at the hostess. For the first moment of Pierre’s outburst, Anna Pavlovna was horrified, accustomed though she was to society; but when she saw that despite the blasphemous speeches uttered by Pierre, the viscount did not lose his temper, and when she became certain that it was now impossible to suppress these speeches, she gathered her forces and, joining the viscount, attacked the orator.::20/3/1994
Bend::186956.07414303505::Avoir l’oreille tir&#233;e par l’Empereur *414 was considered the greatest honor and favor at the French court.::11/9/1988
Carmel::707570.8934396342::“I take them back, I take them back,” said Pierre, “and I beg you to forgive me.” Pierre glanced involuntarily at the torn-off button. “And money, if you need it for the road.”::21/4/1868
San Leandro::288139.62238125235::Anatole, whom he had been seeking, dined that day at Dolokhov’s and discussed with him how to mend the spoiled affair. It seemed necessary to him that he see Miss Rostov. In the evening, he went to his sister’s, to discuss with her the means of arranging this meeting. When Pierre, having driven in vain all over Moscow, returned home, the valet told him that Prince Anatole Vassilievich was with the countess. The countess’s drawing room was filled with guests.::5/5/1854
Templeton::282372.2781843042::“Good-bye, dear heart—it’s always like a harp, listening to him!” said the old prince, holding him by the hand and offering him his cheek for a kiss. The others got up along with Rastopchin.::18/1/1828
Winterpock::937443.7923805686::“For God’s sake, Sonya, don’t tell anyone, don’t torment me,” Natasha pleaded. “Remember, it’s wrong to interfere in such things. I revealed it to you…”::4/11/1982
Stevens Creek::671551.0673231886::“A pretty nice day, eh? For a chase and a gallop, eh?” said Nikolai, scratching Milka behind the ears.::8/7/1915
Millboro::17218.042096708963::“Et demandez-lui si les tirailleurs sont post&#233;s,”  he added. “Ce qu’ils font, ce qu’ils font!” ‡268 he said to himself, still not answering the Austrian.::18/7/1871
Bracey::168571.0733229778::“Yes, mais ce n’est pas comme vous l’entendez, ”*316 Prince Andrei went on. “I never wished, nor do I wish now, any good to that scoundrel of a protocolist, who stole some boots from the militiamen; I’d even be very pleased to see him hanged, but I pity my father—that is, again, myself.”::17/12/2008
Fishers::182536.0443398142::When Prince Meshchersky left, Prince Andrei took Pierre by the arm and invited him to the room he had been given. There was a rumpled bed in the room and open suitcases and trunks. Prince Andrei went over to one of them and took out a box. From the box he took a bundle of papers. He did it all silently and very quickly. He straightened up and cleared his throat. His face was frowning, his lips were compressed.::22/2/1880
Deltona::730446.2627930013::Now it was not, as before, an invisible river flowing in the darkness, but like a gloomy sea subsiding and quivering after a storm. Rostov mindlessly watched and listened to what was happening before him and around him. An infantryman came up to the fire, squatted down, put his hands to the fire, and turned his face away.::8/8/1900
Concord::422280.2778742691::The cannonballs went on regularly whistling and smacking into the ice, into the water, and most often into the crowd that covered the dam, the ponds, and the bank.::14/5/1957
Tracy::262989.8945777127::The princess sank strengthlessly into the armchair next to her father and wept. She now saw her brother at the moment when he had taken leave of her and Liza, with his tender and at the same time arrogant air, saw him at the moment when, tenderly and mockingly, he had put on the little icon. “Did he believe? Did he repent of his unbelief? Was he now there? There, in the place of eternal rest and bliss?” she wondered.::11/5/1867
Moneta::840463.2828337839::That was the count’s favorite dance, which he used to dance while still in his youth. (“Daniel Cooper” was in fact one of the figures of the anglaise .)::11/1/1896
Glen Wilton::200786.64430330606::Before the room from which the sounds of the clavichord came, a pretty blonde Frenchwoman popped out of a side door. Mlle Bourienne seemed wildly ecstatic.::1/8/1929
Eggleston::208863.41845870126::Ilya Andreevich was slightly flushed from the wine and the driving; his eyes, veiled with moisture, had a special glitter, and, wrapped in his fur coat, sitting in his saddle, he had the look of a child made ready to go for a walk.::4/5/1842
Yogaville::716751.9864300473::“I? I? What was I telling you?” Pierre said suddenly, getting up and beginning to pace the room. “I’ve always thought so…This girl is such a treasure, such a…She’s a rare girl…My dear friend, I beg you, don’t be clever, don’t doubt, marry, marry, marry…And I’m sure there’ll be no man happier than you.”::23/6/1800
Suffolk::706580.7100312226::Sonya could not speak any more and again hid her head in her hands and in the featherbed. Natasha began to calm down, but it was clear from her face that she realized all the importance of her friend’s grief.::16/2/1859
Rushmere::582293.2856513332::The concentrated movement which began that morning in the emperors’ headquarters and gave a push to all subsequent movement was like the first movement of the central wheel in a big tower clock. Slowly one wheel started, another turned, a third, and the wheels, pulleys, and gears were set turning more and more quickly, chimes began to ring, figures popped out, and the clock hands started their measured advance, showing the result of that movement.::25/6/1979
Asheville::958211.7215084806::A week later Prince Andrei was a member of the commission on military regulations and, something he had never expected, head of a section of the legislative commission. At Speransky’s request, he took the first part of the civil code, then in the process of being developed, and with the help of the Code Napol&#233;on  and the Justiniani, 9 worked on putting together the section headed “Personal Rights.”::13/3/1802
Dumbarton::276188.78810100845::All through the argument and the rest of dinner, the little princess was silent and kept glancing fearfully now at Princess Marya, now at her father-in-law. When they left the table, she took her sister-in-law by the arm and led her to another room.::17/11/1955
Fort Hunt::216053.7805357834::Anatole had a passport, travel documents, ten thousand roubles taken from his sister, and ten thousand borrowed through the intermediary of Dolokhov.::5/12/1866
Goldvein::878139.773451809::“Si vous envisager la question sous ce point de vue,” †340 he began, articulating in French with obvious difficulty and speaking still more slowly than in Russian, but perfectly calmly. He said that honor, l’honneur,  could not be supported by privileges detrimental to the course of government service, that honor, l’honneur,  was either a negative notion of not committing reprehensible acts, or a well-known source of competition for gaining approval and the rewards expressive of it.::7/7/1890
Prices Fork::92160.13135434798::“It seems there are lots of scribblers around,” said the old prince. “There in Petersburg they’re writing all the time, not only notes but new laws. My Andryusha wrote a whole volume of laws for Russia there. Nowadays everybody writes!” And he laughed unnaturally.::16/6/1819
Rio::132129.5351190558::“Why the postponement? Why no betrothal?” he thought. Talking with his mother once about his sister, he found, to his surprise and partly to his satisfaction, that deep in her heart his mother also sometimes looked mistrustfully at this marriage.::16/3/1946
Livermore::229164.51743492007::Noticing Anna Mikhailovna and her son, Prince Vassily dismissed the doctor with a bow and silently, but with a questioning look, came over to them. The son noticed how deep grief suddenly appeared in his mother’s eyes and smiled slightly.::5/5/1927
Sussex::8661.519203931433::Prince Andrei, without raising his eyes, hastily rode away from the doctor’s wife, who was calling him her savior, and, recalling with disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene, rode on towards the village where he had been told the commander in chief was.::12/1/1853
Newton::143864.93946212254::The little princess and Mlle Bourienne had already received all the necessary information from the maid Masha about what a ruddy, dark-browed, handsome fellow the minister’s son was, and how his papa could barely drag his feet up the stairs, while he, like an eagle, ran up after him taking three steps at a time. On receiving this information, the little princess and Mlle Bourienne, their animatedly chattering voices heard already from the corridor, came into Princess Marya’s room.::1/6/1894
Fort Chiswell::724250.4627159251::“Ah, mon ami, oubliez les torts qu’on a pu avoir envers vous, pensez que c’est votre p&#232;re…peut-&#234;tre &#224; l’agonie.”  She sighed. “Je vous ai tout de suite aim&#233; comme mon fils. Fiez &#224; moi, Pierre. Je n’oublierais pas vos int&#233;r&#234;ts.” *128::7/8/1894
Fall River::906092.3132683196::In the second category Pierre included himself and similar brothers, seeking, vacillating, who had not yet found in Masonry a straight and clear path, but hoped to find one.::2/7/2010
Pungoteague::849854.8788400831::“Seventh,”  said the rhetor, “try by frequent thoughts of death to bring yourself to the point where it no longer seems a fearsome enemy to you, but a friend…who delivers the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from this calamitous life and leads it to the place of recompense and peace.”::19/5/1994
Hot Springs::821117.1689636542::The head steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre’s intentions; but he observed that, besides these transformations, it was generally necessary to take care of things, which were in a bad state.::5/10/1896
Manchester::95643.05924679794::Prince Andrei said this with such enthusiasm that it involuntarily occurred to Pierre that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrei by his father. He made no reply.::22/8/1856
Sandy Level::876520.0239581385::“Well, if it’s long, we can take it up, we can take it up in a minute,” said the resolute Dunyasha, taking a needle out of the fichu on her breast and setting to work again on the floor.::18/11/1905
Menifee::585840.8235856794::“Come here,” said Rostov, seizing Telyanin by the arm. He almost dragged him to the window. “That’s Denisov’s money, you took it…” he whispered in his ear.::22/10/1960
West Falls Church::4835.081138006792::“&#192; celui qui s’est le plus vaillamment conduit dans cette derni&#232;re guerre,” †334 Napoleon added, rapping out every syllable with a calm and assurance that Rostov found outrageous, and looking over the ranks of Russian soldiers standing at attention before him, still presenting arms and looking fixedly at the face of their emperor.::3/2/1880
Weyers Cave::679184.9043101195::The whole day had been hot, there was a thunderstorm gathering somewhere, but only a small cloud had sent a sprinkle over the dust of the road and the juicy leaves. The left side of the woods was dark, in the shade; the right side, wet, glossy, sparkled in the sun, barely swayed by the wind. Everything was in flower; nightingales throbbed and trilled, now near, now far.::15/5/1929
Walkerton::426235.85139739496::“I am not…petitioning for anything, Your Excellency,” Prince Andrei said softly. Arakcheev’s eyes turned towards him.::13/10/1825
Indio::835276.0911614546::“What can I tell you?” said the prince, in a cold, bored tone. “Qu’a-t-on d&#233;cid&#233;? On a d&#233;cid&#233; que Buonaparte a br&#251;l&#233; ses vaisseaux, et je crois que nous sommes en train de br&#251;ler les n&#244;tres. ”§8::23/2/1855
Enon::834249.3264812871::It was extremely strange for Balashov, after his closeness to the highest power and might, after his conversation three hours earlier with the sovereign, and generally in the habit of being honored in his service, to see here, on Russian soil, this hostile, and above all disrespectful, treatment of him by brute force.::10/1/2003
Arvonia::791553.3086908945::“And you know, my friend, it seems to me that Bonaparte has decidedly lost his Latin.4 You know, a letter to the emperor came from him today.” Dolgorukov smiled significantly.::25/1/1854
Isle of Wight::817622.1198778413::“No you don’t, master,” he cried to Nikolai. Nikolai sent his horses into a gallop and outstripped Zakhar. The horses sent a spray of fine, dry snow into the faces of the passengers; beside them was a rapid tinkling of bells and the tangle of quickly moving legs and shadows of the troika they were outstripping. From all sides came women’s shrieks and the whistle of runners over snow.::24/5/1844
Daleville::793361.3315197775::“Ah, voyons. Contez-nous cela, vicomte,” *34 said Anna Pavlovna, joyfully sensing that something &#224; la Louis XV echoed in this phrase, “contez-nous cela, vicomte.”::21/1/1873
Matoaca::849692.3024515901::“About your affair,” Prince Andrei turned to Boris again, “we’ll speak later,” and he glanced at Rostov. “Come to me after the review, we’ll do all that’s possible.”::22/8/1832
Fair Oaks::515495.24853488826::Such passion, the passion of creative contemplation, Tolstoy constantly carried within him. It was precisely in its light that he saw everything in its pristine freshness, in a new way, as if for the first time. The authenticity of what he saw differs so much from what we are used to that it may appear strange to us. But Tolstoy was not seeking that strangeness, was not pursuing it as a goal, still less did he apply it to his works as a literary method.::9/6/1917
Temperanceville::135402.2112307608::And, patting Berg on the shoulder, he got up, wishing to end the conversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that unless he knew for certain what Vera’s dowry would be, and received at least part of what was allotted her in advance, he would be forced to renounce.::22/9/1901
Gratton::892237.4958590592::The princess saw that her father looked unfavorably on this matter, but at the same moment it occurred to her that her fate in life would be decided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not to see his gaze, under the influence of which she felt she could not think but only obey out of habit, and said:::1/3/1941
Franconia::601416.2314146252::The servant brought back his empty, overturned glass and a bitten lump of sugar,2 and asked whether anything was needed.::23/8/1968
Collinsville::286975.11582157906::Prince Ippolit went over to the little princess and, bringing his face down close to hers, began saying something to her in a half whisper. Two footmen, one the princess’s, the other his, waiting for them to finish talking, stood with shawl and redingote and listened to their French talk, which they could not understand, with such faces as if they understood what was being said but did not want to show it. The princess, as usual, talked smilingly and listened laughingly.::6/12/1841
Norwalk::856210.897593823::This gesture was so unlike the princess’s usual calm, the fear that showed on Prince Vassily’s face was so inconsistent with his augustness, that Pierre stopped and looked at his guide questioningly through his spectacles. Anna Mikhailovna expressed no surprise, she only smiled slightly and sighed, as if to show that she had expected it all.::9/2/2002
Cats Bridge::447699.54096689436::Rostov laughed so loudly and merrily that Denisov felt envious in his room, and Natasha, unable to help herself, laughed with him. “No, but it’s nice, isn’t it?” she kept saying.::1/11/1948
Waukegan::142836.29105059203::“Le cabinet de Berlin ne peut pas exprimer un sentiment d’alliance,”  Ippolit began, looking around significantly at them all, “sans exprimer…comme dans sa derni&#232;re note…vous comprenez…vous comprenez…et puis si sa Majest&#233; l’Empereur ne d&#233;roge pas au principe de notre alliance…”::22/11/1852
Bland::644882.4628985871::“Mikhail Ivanovich!” the old prince cried to the architect, who, being busy with the roast, had hoped to be forgotten. “Didn’t I tell you Bonaparte was a great tactician? Well, he says so, too.”::17/3/1832
Huntington::380302.2780027699::“Eh, it’s inevitable!” Nikolai thought for the first and last time. And suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him seem vile to himself, as if he was asking for a carriage in order to go to town, he said to his father:::15/6/2002
Brightwood::476692.22361196985::“And why has the emperor Alexander taken charge of the army? What for? War is my trade, and his business is to rule, not to command troops. Why has he taken such responsibility upon himself?”::12/4/1822
Sanford::613507.7994311927::Nesvitsky and Zherkov were so astounded by this outburst that they silently stared wide-eyed at Bolkonsky.::3/1/1920
Sugar Land::684595.6347597897::The cries and fires in the enemy army came from the fact that, while Napoleon’s orders were being read to the troops, the emperor himself rode around his bivouacs. The soldiers, seeing the emperor, set fire to bundles of straw and ran after him, shouting, “Vive l’empereur!”  Napoleon’s orders were the following:::7/5/1916
Sperryville::389709.05347508186::Prince Andrei sighed, and with a luminous, childlike, tender gaze looked into the flushed, rapturous face of Pierre, who still felt timid before his superior friend.::25/2/1839
Waterford::91310.58586772122::“Ho-o-ow’s that you’re standing? Where’s your leg? Where’s your leg?” the regimental commander shouted with an expression of suffering in his voice, still five men away from Dolokhov, who was wearing a bluish greatcoat.::21/5/1832
Sugarland Run::533963.2205706119::“Peut-&#234;tre plus tard je vous dirai, mon cher, que si je n’avais pas &#233;t&#233; l&#224;, Dieu sait ce que serait arriv&#233;. Vous savez mon oncle avant-hier encore me promettait de ne pas oublier Boris. Mais il n’a pas eu le temps. J’esp&#232;re, mon cher ami, que vous remplirez le d&#233;sir de votre p&#232;re.” *145::6/7/1974
Tiptop::183823.22616523373::“Awaiting orders, Your Excellency, to be dispatched to my new assignment,” replied Boris, showing neither vexation at the prince’s abrupt tone, nor the wish to get into conversation, but so calmly and deferentially that the prince looked at him intently.::2/8/1816
Deerfield::13549.675798818716::“You are unhappy, my dear sir,” he went on. “You are young, I am old. I should like to help you as much as I can.”::1/6/1935
Meadowbrook::306898.71121343394::“I don’t know how to answer your question,” he said, blushing without knowing why himself. “I decidedly don’t know what kind of girl she is; I simply cannot analyze her. She’s enchanting. But why, I don’t know: that’s all one can say about her.”::8/8/1921
Selma::925023.22560097::“God knows what the people here may think,” Telyanin murmured, seizing his peaked cap and going into a small empty room, “we must have a talk…”::12/1/2014
Churchville::242920.29256413528::Of the three precepts of Masonry, Pierre realized that he was not fulfilling the one which required every Mason to be an example of the moral life, and of the seven virtues he was totally lacking in two: good character and the love of death. He comforted himself by thinking that he was fulfilling another duty instead—the setting to rights of the human race—and had other virtues—love of his neighbor and, especially, generosity.::21/2/1897
Springville::503951.0580322001::The princess glanced at her watch and noticing that she was already five minutes late for playing the clavichord, went with a frightened face to the sitting room. According to the established order of the day, between noon and two o’clock the prince rested and the princess played the clavichord.::1/5/1927
Fort Smith::817740.454587144::“Only fools and profligates can be unwell, my boy, and you know me: I’m busy from morning till evening, I’m temperate, and so I’m well.”::21/10/1948
Saxe::645095.7741038947::The French had been beaten off for the last time. And again, in total darkness, Tushin’s guns, as if framed by the humming infantry, moved on somewhere.::21/9/1918
Parrott::24722.498406027804::It was the second night that the two of them had not slept, looking after the boy, who was burning with fever. For two whole days, not trusting their house doctor and expecting the one they had sent for from town, they had been trying now one, now another remedy. Worn out by sleeplessness and anxiety, they shifted their grief onto each other, reproached each other, and quarreled.::21/1/1892
Hawthorne::45874.88519445582::Her voice, Mlle Bourienne’s, and Katya’s, who was laughing about something, blended into a merry warbling which resembled the song of birds.::17/8/1957
Potomac Mills::478678.67713469715::“Sophie,” he said, timidly at first, then more and more boldly, “if you want to refuse not only a brilliant but an advantageous match; but he’s a wonderful, noble man…he’s my friend…”::17/11/1916
Great Falls::426331.6148100682::Rostov, hunching his shoulders as water ran down his neck, was smoking his pipe and listening inattentively, glancing now and then at the young officer Ilyin, who huddled up to him. This officer, a sixteen-year-old boy who had recently joined the regiment, was now in relation to Nikolai what Nikolai had been in relation to Denisov seven years ago. Ilyin tried to imitate Rostov in everything, and was in love with him like a woman.::19/11/2004
Naruna::13849.030246000371::The uncle played another song, then a waltz; then, after a pause, he cleared his throat and struck up his favorite hunting song:::25/3/1831
Nashua::121050.22327645631::Prince Nikolai Andreich, who had always laughed at medical science, had recently, on the advice of Mlle Bourienne, admitted this doctor to his presence and grown used to him. M&#233;tivier called on the prince twice a week.::3/11/1902
Skyland Estates::24906.13987147816::“Can it be that he’s my husband, precisely this stranger, this handsome, kind man—above all, kind,” thought Princess Marya, and fear, which hardly ever came to her, came over her now. She was afraid to look around; she fancied someone was standing there behind the screen, in the dark corner. And that someone was he—the devil—and he was this man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red mouth.::1/8/1863
Lynch Station::922853.3164130958::From all these parties, one more, the ninth party, emerged and began to raise its voice just as Prince Andrei came to the army. This was a party of older people, intelligent, experienced in statesmanship, and who were able, without sharing any of these contradictory opinions, to look at everything that went on at headquarters abstractly, and to reflect on the means of getting out of this uncertainty, irresolution, confusion, and weakness.::5/8/1952
Claypool Hill::20322.44780449266::“I wouldn’t have believed it if someone had told me I could love so much,” said Prince Andrei. “It’s quite a different feeling from what I knew before. The whole world is divided for me into two parts: one is she, and there is all happiness, hope, light; the other is where she is not, and there everything is dejection and darkness…”::4/2/1983
Chino::193644.45900987758::“I have come by the will of the sovereign emperor to learn from Your Excellency what chances you intend to give to the memorandum submitted,” Prince Andrei said courteously.::2/7/2000
Kirkland::215575.66966272812::“Eh bien, vous ne dites rien, admirateur et courtisan de l’Empereur Alexandre?” †415 he said, as if it was ridiculous in his presence to be anyone else’s courtisan  and admirateur  than his, Napoleon’s.::21/10/1852
Edinburg::376852.6186283029::But Dolokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief, pulled it off, and showed the clotted blood on his head.::4/3/1921
Reading::641052.3815122512::“How do you mean, what the devil is a letter?” said Boris, picking it up and reading the address. “You need this letter very much.”::25/5/1808
Dunn Loring::880381.3551909212::He wanted to resolve it, but felt with terror that in this case he lacked the resolve that he knew he had and that indeed was in him. Pierre was one of those people who are strong only when they feel themselves perfectly pure. And since the day when he had been possessed by that feeling of desire which he had experienced over the snuffbox at Anna Pavlovna’s, an unconscious feeling of guilt on account of that attraction had paralyzed his resolve.::24/1/1918
Bellingham::209835.597199559::“Believe me,” said Prince Dolgorukov, addressing Bagration, “this is nothing but a ruse: he has retreated and has ordered the rear guard to light fires and make noise in order to deceive us.”::19/1/1808
Citrus Heights::28163.905572299198::The hunter on the knoll stood with his whip raised; the gentlemen rode up to him at a walk; the hounds, running just on the horizon, were turning away from the hare; the rest of the hunters were also riding away. Everything moved slowly and sedately.::10/9/1895
Concord::866307.3941611216::He embraced his daughter, then Pierre again, and kissed him with his old man’s mouth. Tears actually wet his cheeks.::17/1/1847
Whittier::526411.6950589049::The countess was so tired out from the visits that she ordered no one else to be received, and the porter was told simply to be sure to invite for dinner everyone who came by with congratulations. The countess wanted to talk personally with her childhood friend, Princess Anna Mikhailovna, whom she had not seen properly since her return from Petersburg. Anna Mikhailovna, with her weepy and pleasant face, moved closer to the countess’s armchair.::6/5/1981
Modest Town::204858.10090721547::“And I wished so much to thank Uncle  for all his benefactions to me and to Borya. C’est son filleul, ”*100 she added in such a tone, as though this news was to make Prince Vassily extremely glad.::15/1/1967
Fairlawn::571386.1646693066::Dolokhov, with a cold smile and flashing his beautiful, insolent eyes, looked at him, clearly wanting to taunt him a little longer.::7/12/1963

Newport Beach::171508.71159452497::“You don’t know, Bolkonsky,” Bilibin turned to Prince Andrei, “that all the horrors of the French army (I almost said the Russian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the women.”::21/7/1806
University Center::875006.7620521636::“And how does he look at the matter now?” asked Pierre, meaning the old prince. Princess Marya shook her head.::1/1/1836
Lively::138926.7378871921::“Let’s see…” Anatole looked at his watch. “We’ll go at once. Look sharp, Balaga. Eh? Will you make it?”::8/11/1927
Nethers::364935.5649657704::“Well, what is it tonight?” asked her mother, settling on the pillows and waiting until Natasha, having kicked her feet and turned over twice, lay next to her under the same blanket, her arms on top it, her expression serious.::11/3/1907
Hampden Sydney::562455.8343548392::The conversation did not flag all evening, turning mostly around political news. At the end of the evening it became especially lively when things got around to the rewards bestowed by the sovereign.::14/6/1946
Champaign::602613.3293715373::The princess, smiling and talking with everyone, suddenly effected the transposition, and, taking a seat, cheerily settled herself.::12/12/1974
Sutherland::498773.2869367011::“Je vous demande pardon, une tabati&#232;re avec le portrait de l’Empereur est une r&#233;compense, mais point une distinction,”  said the diplomat, “un cadeau plut&#244;t.” *307::23/10/1844
Duluth::679633.7370203973::Sometimes, looking at the strange but funny steps the dancers made, having decided once and for all that, as they were dressed up, no one could recognize them, and therefore not feeling embarrassed—Pelageya Danilovna covered her face with her handkerchief, and her whole corpulent body shook with unrestrainable, kindly, old-woman’s laughter.::19/6/1980
O'Fallon::94814.46486755107::He exchanged a few words with Prince Andrei and Chernyshov about the present war, with the expression of a man who knows beforehand that it will all go badly and who is not even displeased by that. The unbrushed tufts of hair on his nape and his hastily slicked down side-whiskers were the most eloquent confirmation of it.::1/5/2017
Purdy::156966.66142370785::“But you know, Countess,” he said suddenly, addressing her like an old, long-standing acquaintance, “we’re organizing a costume carousel; you must take part in it: we’ll have great fun. Everybody’s getting together at the Arkharovs’. Please come, won’t you?” he said.::6/7/1918
Highland Springs::174916.49083857308::“Here they come with another one!” said one of the officers, pointing to a captured French dragoon whom two Cossacks were leading along on foot.::25/8/1837
Massanetta Springs::848343.0987751492::“Yes, mais ce n’est pas comme vous l’entendez, ”*316 Prince Andrei went on. “I never wished, nor do I wish now, any good to that scoundrel of a protocolist, who stole some boots from the militiamen; I’d even be very pleased to see him hanged, but I pity my father—that is, again, myself.”::20/11/1852
Clifton::831580.8546788169::“No, I can’t believe it,” Sonya repeated. “I don’t understand. How is it that you’ve loved a man for a whole year and suddenly…You’ve only seen him three times, Natasha, I don’t believe you, you’re joking. To forget everything in three days and so…”::15/11/1841
Chantilly::945470.1820343692::He reached out and put his hand on the purse. Rostov let go of it. Telyanin took the purse and began to lower it into the pocket of his riding breeches, his eyebrows raised casually, and his mouth slightly open, as if he was saying: “Yes, yes, I’m putting my purse in my pocket, and it’s quite simple, and it’s nobody’s business.”::20/2/2003
New Hope::631972.0656298163::The count and Semyon looked at him. Suddenly, as often happens, the sound of the chase instantly drew close, as if the dogs’ baying muzzles and Danilo’s hallooing were just in front of them.::12/6/1803
Dry Fork::230940.8112879271::“But I have nothing with me,” said Pierre, thinking that he was being asked to hand over everything he owned.::23/8/1903
Toano::503173.0467352955::“You don’t mind, Your Honor?” he said, turning questioningly to Tushin. “I’ve strayed from my company, Your Honor; I don’t know where myself. Worse luck!”::3/6/1978

Jewell Ridge::792589.2071255065::“I’m saying it to you sincerely as a friend. Consider. Where will you go now, and what for, when you can stay here?

Here’s what I am.” Natasha rounded her arms, took up her skirt as if to dance, ran a few steps, turned, made an entrechat, tapped her foot against her ankle, and went a few steps on the very tips of her toes. “See me standing? So there!” she said; but she could not hold it. “That’s what I am! I’ll never marry anyone, I’ll become a dancer. Only don’t tell anybody.”::11/12/1926

Redwood City::37338.72371389902::“They don’t hear…I told them twice!…they don’t hear! She’s the first person in this house; she’s my best friend,” cried the prince. “And,” he shouted wrathfully, addressing Princess Marya for the first time, “if you allow yourself once more, as you did yesterday…to forget yourself before her, I’ll show you who is master in this house. Out! I don’t want to see you! Apologize to her!”::15/11/2013
Central Point::562980.3065552833::“Allez voir, mon cher, si la troisi&#232;me division a d&#233;pass&#233; le village. Dites-lui de s’arr&#234;ter et d’attendre mes ordres.” †267::22/11/1802
Lowes Island::150698.3045064474::Four days earlier, the sentinels of the Preobrazhensky regiment were standing by the house to which Balashov was brought; now two French grenadiers stood there, in blue uniforms open on the chest and shaggy hats.

As soon as the king began to speak loudly and quickly, all his kingly dignity instantly left him, and, not noticing it himself, he went over to his proper tone of good-natured familiarity. He placed his hand on the withers of Balashov’s horse.::1/4/1940
Madison Heights::515105.6477169468::“Ah, I know that. I know, I know,” Natasha picked up. “I was still little when it happened to me.

Santa Fe::401072.44016146095::He gave her a cold, angry look and offered her his wrinkled, clean-shaven cheek.

Mission::337098.37363689154::“Soyez homme, mon ami, c’est moi qui veillerai &#224; vos int&#233;r&#234;ts,” †129 she said in response to his look and went still more quickly down the corridor.::4/9/1891
Bryan::176822.95029840834::Supposing that such a reception could be given him only because Davout did not know that he was the emperor Alexander’s adjutant general and even his representative before Napoleon, Balashov hastened to inform him of his rank and purpose.

And he had not made use of it…“What have I done?” he thought.

Rocky Gap::599411.7361347663::Without replying either to his wife or to his mother-in-law, Pierre got ready for the road late one night and left for Moscow to see Iosif Alexeevich. Here is what Pierre wrote in his diary:::23/10/1883

Largo::915256.2143595745::“Ah, my friend, he’s very unfortunate,” she said. “If what we’ve heard is true, it’s terrible. And could we have thought of it when we rejoiced over his happiness?

Dryden::177308.25301747487::“Well, now, Mikhail Ivanovich, things are going badly for our friend Buonaparte.

Elk Hill::544599.0290078243::As her animation increased, the prince looked at her more and more sternly, and suddenly, as if he had studied her enough and arrived at a clear idea of her, turned away and addressed Mikhail Ivanovich.::2/10/1806
Horntown::426028.4894445111::“Don’t raise dust, you footsloggers!” joked a hussar, whose horse, prancing, splashed mud at the infantryman.::5/2/2007
Low Moor::596040.1328234486::“Yes, we know, but what I know as evil for myself, I cannot do to another person,” Prince Andrei was speaking more and more animatedly, clearly wishing to voice his new view of things to Pierre. He spoke in French. “Je ne connais dans la vie que deux maux bien r&#233;els: c’est le remords et la maladie. Il n’est de bien que l’absence de ces maux. *315 To live for myself, only avoiding these two evils—that is all my wisdom now.”::16/9/1824

Gloucester::198881.85048239282::Rostov explained to him that he would like to see the hussar major Denisov, who was a patient there.::23/8/1875

Belspring::116489.80522579211::Pierre took the bundle of papers. Prince Andrei, as if trying to remember if he had something else to say, or waiting for Pierre to say something, stood looking at him with fixed eyes.::22/9/1923
Cicero::426878.0413544083::“Mon ami!”  the mother said in a pleading voice, again touching her son’s hand as if this touch could calm or encourage him.::14/3/1811

Avondale::836283.3586135468::“I’ve heard about you,” the traveler went on, “and about the misfortune that has befallen you, my dear sir.” (He underlined, as it were, the word misfortune,  as if to say: “Yes, misfortune, whatever you may call it, I know that what happened to you in Moscow was a misfortune.”) “I am very sorry for it, my dear sir.”::12/8/1961
Savage Town::927461.2444721541::Natasha involuntarily gazed at that neck, the shoulders, the pearls, the coiffure, and admired the beauty of the shoulders and pearls. As Natasha looked at her a second time, the lady turned and, meeting Count Ilya Andreich’s eyes, nodded to him and smiled. This was Countess Bezukhov, Pierre’s wife. Ilya Andreich, who knew everybody in the world, leaned over and addressed her.::17/4/1811
Sioux City::74670.17806186949::Pierre blushed and, hastily lowering his legs from the bed, leaned towards the old man, smiling unnaturally and timidly.::14/5/1807
Blue Ridge::33827.770679434434::When Pierre came up to them, he noticed that Vera was conversing with self-satisfied enthusiasm, while Prince Andrei seemed embarrassed (which seldom happened to him).::3/9/1895
Ravensworth::501059.8596151671::“You owe me forty-three thousand, Count,” said Dolokhov, and he stood up from the table and stretched. “It’s tiring, though, to sit so long,” he said.::21/2/1913
Merced::923714.5299318037::“Mama, can we talk? Say yes,” said Natasha. “Well, so one kiss here, another, and that’s it.” And she embraced her mother’s neck and kissed her under the chin.

McCoy::262114.52106956457::“Charm&#233;e de vous voir. Je suis tr&#232;s contente de vous voir,” §320 she said to Pierre as he was kissing her hand. She had known him as a child, and now his friendship with Andrei, the misfortune with his wife, and, above all, his kind, simple face disposed her towards him. She looked at him with her beautiful, luminous eyes and seemed to be saying: “I like you very much, but please don’t laugh at my people. ” Having exchanged the first phrases of greeting, they sat down.::12/8/1837
Bellwood::182484.6213758987::“Well, what is this, gentlemen?” the staff officer said in a tone of reproach, like a man who has already repeated the same thing several times. “You can’t absent yourselves like this. The prince ordered that nobody should be found here. Well, take you, Mister Staff Captain,” he addressed a small, dirty, thin artillery officer, who was standing bootless before the entering men (he had given his boots to the sutler to dry), just in his stockings, smiling not quite naturally.::16/5/1896
Shawsville::243441.51699107076::“Only fools and profligates can be unwell, my boy, and you know me: I’m busy from morning till evening, I’m temperate, and so I’m well.”::9/12/1839

Wyndham::418028.1746625247::Prince Bagration looked at Tushin and, obviously not wishing to show any mistrust of Bolkonsky’s sharp judgment, and at the same time feeling himself unable to believe him fully, inclined his head and told Tushin he could go. Prince Andrei went out after him.::21/9/1932

Pratts::181776.51035200217::The island of the Otradnoe reserve could be seen about two hundred yards away, and the kennelmen were approaching it.

Pastoria::514693.43568960624::Natasha looked at Sonya with astonished eyes. Clearly, this question had presented itself to her for the first time, and she did not know how to answer it.::22/12/1919
Union Level::132567.46196280266::“Well, let’s give it a try, Captain, see how far it will carry!” said the general, turning to the artillerist. “Have some fun out of boredom.”::21/3/1852

Mount Airy::761135.9942927832::The rumor that had already spread earlier about the defeat of the Austrians and the surrender of the entire army at Ulm turned out to be true.

Ferrum::761341.4925271244::“No, it’s a chorus from The Water-Carrier, 8 don’t you hear?” And Natasha finished singing the chorus to give Sonya the idea.::22/12/1972

Triplet::710516.6169191168::Sonya did not remember much of what they remembered, and what she did remember did not evoke in her the poetic feeling they experienced. She only delighted in their joy, trying to imitate it.::13/2/1804
Medford::960358.0528394748::Rostov went on ahead to carry out his errand, and, to his great surprise, discovered that Dolokhov, this rowdy duellist, lived in Moscow with his old mother and hunchbacked sister, and was a most affectionate son and brother.::9/3/1824
Owenton::925378.0007720242::The French, who had stopped firing on this field strewn with dead and wounded because there was nothing left alive on it, seeing an adjutant riding across it, aimed a cannon and fired several shots. The sensation of these whistling, fearsome sounds and the surrounding dead merged for Rostov into a single impression of terror and pity for himself. He recalled his mother’s last letter. “What would she feel,” he wondered, “if she saw me here now, on this field, with cannon aimed at me?”::24/2/1893

Melbourne::55782.142158001705::Just then Anna Mikhailovna stepped inaudibly into the room, with the business-like, preoccupied, and at the same time meek Christian look that never left her.

He explained this coat of arms to her with a significant air, as if the princess had asked him about it.::6/5/1888
Warfield::963951.288984643::“I don’t understand,” said Pierre, fearfully sensing doubt arising in him.

Folsom::12430.711920872416::Two of the Pavlogradsky squadrons made their bivouac in the middle of a rye field, already in ear but totally trampled down by cattle and horses. It was pouring rain, and Rostov, with the young officer Ilyin, whom he patronized, was sitting under a hastily slapped-together lean-to. An officer of their regiment, with long mustaches that continued across his cheeks, who was coming back from the staff and got caught by the rain, stopped to see Rostov.::11/7/1822

Cannonades and gunfire, blending, rumbled on the right and in the center, and the French greatcoats of Lannes’s riflemen were already passing the mill dam and forming up on this side, two musket shots away. The infantry general went up to a horse with his bouncing gait, mounted it, becoming very straight and tall, and rode to the Pavlogradsky commander.

Hammond::170589.28698610488::The accoucheur came in. Prince Andrei left, and, meeting Princess Marya, went up to her again. They spoke in whispers, but the conversation stopped every other minute. They waited and listened.::9/9/1866
Baileys Crossroads::764309.3777696562::Having drawn even with the infantry guards, he noticed that cannonballs were flying over and around them, not so much because he heard the sound of the cannon, but because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers’ faces, and on the officers’ an unnatural military solemnity.::15/5/1912

Reston::11836.977460309206::The French, who had stopped firing on this field strewn with dead and wounded because there was nothing left alive on it, seeing an adjutant riding across it, aimed a cannon and fired several shots. The sensation of these whistling, fearsome sounds and the surrounding dead merged for Rostov into a single impression of terror and pity for himself.

I’m surprised that mama could say it to me. Because Sonya’s poor,” he thought, “does it mean I can’t love her, can’t respond to her faithful, devoted love?

Lake Charles::905587.9337205347::“Yes, indeed, there’s a true wise man!” thought Pierre. “He doesn’t see anything beyond the present moment of pleasure, nothing troubles him—and therefore he’s always cheerful, content, and calm.

Boris was now a rich man, far advanced in honors, no longer seeking patronage, but standing on an equal footing with the highest of his peers.::4/11/1883
New Canton::354012.95122530917::“De l’histoire ancienne,”  said a third, realizing that the talk was about former wars. “L’Empereur va lui faire voir &#224; votre Souvara, comme les autres…” †220::17/1/1849

Kalamazoo::133126.2166798185::“What do you mean, excellent?” Natasha said with reproach, feeling the tone with which her brother had said it. “It’s not excellent, it’s simply lovely!” Just as the uncle’s mushrooms, honey, and liqueurs seemed the best in the world to her, so this song, too, seemed to her at that moment the height of musical loveliness.::15/11/1996

Simpsons::880576.0903511667::“I’m afraid,” said Pierre, smiling and hesitating between the trust which the Mason personally inspired in him and his habit of mocking Masonic beliefs, “I’m afraid I’m very far from understanding—how shall I put it—I’m afraid my way of thinking about the universe is so much the opposite of yours that we won’t understand each other.”::18/1/1966

Boynton Beach::391553.89525748853::“Since last evening my fate is sealed: to be loved by you or to die. I have no other way out,” the letter began. Then he wrote that he knew the family would not give her to him, that there were secret reasons for that which he could reveal only to her, but that if she loved him, she had only to say the word “yes” and no human powers would prevent their bliss.

The three parts of this army could be clearly distinguished from each other: Kutuzov’s fighting force (in which the Pavlogradsky regiment stood on the right flank in the front line), the infantry and guards regiments come from Russia, and the Austrian troops. But they all stood in one line, under one command, and in the same order.::8/11/1853
Arlington Heights::699175.4447082632::“Good-bye, thank you very much. The sovereign emperor will probably wish to see you,” he repeated and inclined his head.::22/3/1965
Gainesville::41539.2161584307::“I have the pleasure of being acquainted, if the countess remembers me,” said Prince Andrei, with a courteous and low bow, totally contradicting Mme Peronsky’s remark about his rudeness, going up to Natasha and raising his arm to put it around her waist even before he finished asking her to dance. He suggested a turn of the waltz. That rapt expression of Natasha’s face, ready for despair and for ecstasy, suddenly lit up with a happy, grateful, childlike smile.::19/12/1879
Woodlawn::705639.8817157147::“I beg your pardon! I beg your pardon! As God is my witness, I didn’t know,” the old man muttered, and, having looked Natasha up and down, he left. Mlle Bourienne was the first to recover after this apparition and began talking about the prince’s ill health. Natasha and Princess Marya silently looked at each other, and the longer they looked at each other silently, without saying what they needed to say, the more ill-willed were their thoughts about each other.::1/11/1891
Linton Hall::811137.0978038089::“That is just why I do not begin, Sire,” Kutuzov said in a ringing voice, as if to forestall the possibility of not being heard, and again something twitched in his face. “I do not begin, Sire, because we are not on parade and not on the Tsaritsyn Field,” he uttered clearly and distinctly.::18/7/1814
Rivanna::507202.2143697764::“Whoa! Giddap, now!…Whoa!” the cries of Balaga and the young fellow sitting on the box were all that was heard. On Arbat Square the troika snagged a carriage, something cracked, there was a shout, and the troika flew along the Arbat.::12/4/1973
Glenvar::95297.0207496614::He was red, all in a sweat, though it was not hot in the room. And his face was frightful and pitiful, especially in its impotent desire to seem calm.::12/1/1938
Union City::39296.30303367071::Seeing that smile, Rostov involuntarily began to smile himself and felt a still stronger surge of love for his sovereign. He wanted to show his love for the sovereign in some way. He knew that this was impossible and wanted to cry. The sovereign summoned the regimental commander and said a few words to him.::15/12/1867
Fieldale::707823.9363410027::“Good-bye, thank you very much. The sovereign emperor will probably wish to see you,” he repeated and inclined his head.::20/2/1883
Burke::913436.0920522965::The curtain rose again. Anatole left the box calm and cheerful. Natasha returned to her father’s box, now totally subjected to the world she was in. Everything that was happening before her now seemed perfectly natural to her; but instead all her former thoughts about her fianc&#233;, about Princess Marya, about country life, never once entered her head, as if it was all long ago, long past.::16/6/2000
Bethlehem::730835.1995824269::The financial affairs of the Rostovs did not improve during the two years they spent in the country.::9/5/1933
Draper::239885.38087020285::“I beg Your Majesty’s pardon,” said Balashov, “besides Russia there is also Spain, where there are just as many churches and monasteries.”::15/5/1817
Motley::998375.0227383389::Having come to Moscow on leave a few days earlier, Boris had wished to be introduced to Prince Nikolai Andreich, and had managed to win his favor to such a degree that the prince had made him an exception among all the young bachelors, whom he did not receive.::9/8/1905
Spotsylvania::802643.8441105445::“She’s worn out, she ran him down three times by herself,” Nikolai said, also not listening to anyone and not caring whether anyone was listening to him.::22/6/1828
Laurel Hill::676416.3342141052::“Well, what are they getting at me for?…” Tushin thought to himself, looking fearfully at his superior.::9/3/1998
Paint Bank::546312.6236753549::It was clear that Prince Andrei’s mocking attitude towards the wanderers and Princess Marya’s useless intercession for them were habitual, well-established relations between them.::17/6/1896
Evanston::234245.14526773288::On entering the village, he got off his horse and went to the first house, intending to rest for at least a moment, eat something, and bring clarity to all these insulting, tormenting thoughts. “These are not troops, they’re a mob of ruffians,” he was thinking as he went to the window of the first house, when a familiar voice called his name.::5/1/1894
Jonesboro::24042.203698918962::Coming out to the waiting room from Kutuzov’s office, Prince Andrei, holding the papers, went up to his colleague on duty, the adjutant Kozlovsky, who was sitting by the window with a book.::20/2/1958
Aquia Harbour::409230.0433287884::“That’s my Mitka the coachman…I bought him a good balalaika, I like it,” said the uncle. It was the uncle’s custom that, when he came back from the hunt, Mitka would play the balalaika in the bachelor hunters’ room. The uncle liked listening to this music.::25/5/1841
Franklin::591491.4960805235::“Never mind, my dear count,” she said, closing her eyes meekly. “And I’ll go to Bezukhov’s myself,” she said. “Young Bezukhov has arrived, and we’ll now get everything from his conservatory. I have to see him anyway. He has sent me a letter from Boris. Thank God, Boris is with the staff now.”::5/6/1817
Morrisville::460868.1984728059::On the way to his sister’s room, in the gallery that connected one house to the other, Prince Andrei met the sweetly smiling Mlle Bourienne, who three times that day had already run into him with her rapturous and na&#239;ve smile in secluded passages.::3/10/1832
Missouri City::324506.32943134086::“But you know, Countess,” he said suddenly, addressing her like an old, long-standing acquaintance, “we’re organizing a costume carousel; you must take part in it: we’ll have great fun. Everybody’s getting together at the Arkharovs’. Please come, won’t you?” he said.::16/5/1835
Makemie Park::182570.51319398265::With trembling hands Natasha held this passionate love letter, composed for Anatole by Dolokhov, and, reading it, she found in it echoes of everything she thought she felt herself.::13/10/1856
Chester::671257.5012639051::“The sovereign?…No, a minister…prince…ambassador…Don’t you see the feathers?…” came from the crowd. One person in the crowd, better dressed than the others, seemed to know everyone and called by name the most distinguished dignitaries of that time.::9/5/1837
Bolingbrook::492047.34873973276::“Attendez-moi, je vais prendre mon ouvrage,”  she said. “Voyons, &#224; quoi pensez-vous?”  she turned to Prince Ippolit. “Apportez-moi mon reticule.” ‡38::17/6/1863
Seven Corners::677714.5395485477::“He knows everything,” said Marya Dmitrievna, pointing to Pierre and addressing Natasha. “Let him tell you whether I’ve spoken the truth.”::25/11/1988
Seaford::159414.70353658116::“Connaissez-vous le proverbe:  ‘Jerome, Jerome, stay close to home, keep your shovel in the loam’?” asked Shinshin, wincing and smiling. “Cela nous convient &#224; merveille.  Take Suvorov35—even he got beaten &#224; plate couture,  and where are our Suvorovs now? Je vous demande un peu,” †114 he said, constantly switching from Russian to French.::8/3/1879
Schaumburg::953636.5718666731::In the front hall, Denisov, crouching on the threshold with his pipe, sat facing the sergeant major, who was reporting something. Seeing Rostov, Denisov winced and pointed over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where Telyanin was sitting, winced again, and shuddered with loathing.::7/9/1898
Camden::546781.299019192::The next day Rostov saw off Denisov, who did not want to remain in Moscow a day longer. All Denisov’s Moscow friends were seeing him off at the Gypsies’, and he did not remember how he was put in the sleigh and driven the first three posting stations.::16/8/1982
Iowa City::798523.0954150277::“Why don’t you begin, Mikhail Larionovich?” the emperor Alexander hurriedly addressed Kutuzov, at the same time glancing courteously at the emperor Franz.::5/4/1875
Groveton::311242.25221423776::“When shall I bring it, Your Excellency?” asked Mitenka. “Allow me to tell you that…However, please don’t worry,” he added, noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly, which was always a sign of incipient wrath. “I almost forgot…Shall I deliver it this minute?”::7/8/1800
Disputanta::957322.0514439928::“But Your Excellency knows the wise rule which prescribes that one should assume the worst,” said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to put an end to the joking and get down to business.::5/9/1891
Goochland::217912.0396697627::When the second act was over, Countess Bezukhov got up, turned to the Rostovs’ box (her bosom was now completely bared), beckoned to the old count with her gloved finger, and, ignoring the people who came into her box, began talking to him with an amiable smile.::2/6/1864
Oriskany::477004.01854528184::“Home,” said Pierre, throwing open the bearskin coat on his broad, joyfully breathing chest, despite the ten degrees of frost.::12/3/1921
Chula::560485.8232937591::Both were silent; there were two Germans in the room and a Russian officer. Everyone was silent, and only the clank of knives against plates was heard and the lieutenant’s chomping. When Telyanin finished his lunch, he took a double purse from his pocket, opened the clasp with his small, white, upturned fingers, took out a gold coin and, raising his eyebrows, gave it to the waiter.::21/11/1891
Captains Cove::488515.7054089537::“Have these gentlemen looked after and taken to my bivouac; have my doctor Larrey examine their wounds. Good-bye, Prince Repnin.” And, touching up his horse, he galloped on.::14/9/1876
Lorton::336048.15779695596::“What do I care about your allies?” said Napoleon. “I have the Poles for allies: there are eighty thousand of them, they fight like lions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them.”::25/1/1936
Laymantown::446397.5116704165::The next day Rostov saw off Denisov, who did not want to remain in Moscow a day longer. All Denisov’s Moscow friends were seeing him off at the Gypsies’, and he did not remember how he was put in the sleigh and driven the first three posting stations.::3/9/1875
Warner Robins::4251.8389305235::“That’s doubtful,” said Prince Andrei. “Monsieur le vicomte  quite rightly supposes that things have already gone too far. I think it would be hard to return to the old ways.”::9/11/1804
Appleton::266344.1481118023::Bagration called to the officer, and Tushin went over to the general, putting three fingers to his visor in a timid and awkward movement, not as military men salute, but as priests bless. Though Tushin’s guns were meant to be shooting into the hollow, he was sending fireballs at the village of Sch&#246;ngraben visible straight ahead, before which large masses of French were moving forward.::2/6/1858
Rapid City::388590.5283693797::“So you’re not afraid to gamble with me?” Dolokhov repeated, and, as if in order to tell a merry story, he set the cards down, leaned back in his chair, and, with a smile, slowly began to speak:::6/6/1884
Pleasant Valley::27312.979686818893::“Ah, my dear fellow! My head is spinning,” said the old man, smiling to his son, as if embarrassed. “You might at least help me! We need singers. I have musicians, but shall we invite some Gypsies? You military folk like that.”::11/11/1985
Crozet::631724.7258541366::Anna Pavlovna all but closed her eyes as a sign that neither she nor anyone else could judge of the empress’s good pleasure or liking.::24/5/1894
New Braunfels::364007.3946449415::“Yes,” said Boris, blushing involuntarily for some reason, “I thought of asking the commander in chief; he received a letter about me from Prince Kuragin; I wanted to ask,” he added, as if apologizing, “because I’m afraid the guards won’t see action.”::4/4/1897
Midland::4168.5510217231995::“Just so, just so,” the countess repeated and, shaking all over, she laughed a kindly, unexpected, old woman’s laugh.::13/10/1848
Scotland::149761.97214095198::“It’s not that I don’t remember him—I know how he is, but I don’t remember him the way I do Nikolenka. I close my eyes, and I remember him, but Boris I don’t” (she closed her eyes), “no—nothing!”::8/3/1813
Greenville::621705.2246526929::“Ah, for pity’s sake, Count, I understand very well,” said Berg, getting up and speaking to himelf in a guttural voice.::11/11/1823
Albany::611901.0322459595::But Dolokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief, pulled it off, and showed the clotted blood on his head.::14/1/1995
Fairfield::705495.9359901454::On all sides there were loving eyes, glistening with tears of joy, there were lips that wanted to kiss him.::13/10/1960
Ruckersville::302267.92464654037::“The thing is, my friend—what’s this stain you’ve got there?” she said, pointing to his waistcoat. “Must be the saut&#233;, ” she added, smiling. “The thing is, Count, that I need money.”::12/4/1879
Arcola::796456.3197661163::Sonya, Natasha, Petya, Anna Mikhailovna, Vera, the old count embraced him; servants and maids filled the room, talking and ah-ing.::14/2/1991
Dundas::54191.61989781396::Prince Andrei, who, to complete the trophy of prisoners, was also brought out before the eyes of the emperor, could not fail to attract his attention. Napoleon evidently remembered seeing him on the battlefield, and, turning to him, used the same appellation of young man, jeune homme,  under which Bolkonsky had been imprinted on his memory the first time.::12/3/1850
Temple::682447.8140184192::“Yes, yes, I love him!” thought Natasha, rereading the letter for the twentieth time and seeking some special, deep meaning in each word.::6/9/1981
Flower Mound::450209.1888157122::“I don’t know of who,  Colonel,” the cornet replied earnestly, “only the prince told me: ‘Go and tell the colonel that the hussars must turn back quickly and set fire to the bridge.’”::5/4/2017
Floris::822930.1982081976::Marya Dmitrievna and the countess laughed, and all the guests followed suit. Everyone laughed not at Marya Dmitrievna’s reply, but at the inconceivable boldness and adroitness of this girl, who was both smart and pert enough to treat Marya Dmitrievna that way.::1/9/2019
Massies Mill::748867.3897109687::On returning from leave, joyfully welcomed by his comrades, Nikolai had been sent for a remount and had brought excellent horses from Little Russia, which pleased him and earned him the praises of his superiors. During his absence, he had been promoted to captain, and when the regiment was put on wartime status with an increased complement, he was again given his old squadron.::11/2/1832
Rochester Hills::763261.9598902924::The princess lay in the armchair, and Mlle Bourienne rubbed her temples. Princess Marya, supporting her sister-in-law, went on looking with her beautiful, tear-filled eyes at the door through which Prince Andrei had gone and making signs of the cross at him. From the study, like gunshots, came the oft-repeated angry sounds of the old man blowing his nose. As soon as Prince Andrei left, the door to the study quickly opened, and the old man’s stern figure appeared in its white smock.::4/12/2013
Shenandoah Farms::858747.5550079534::“Take this and deliver it,” the minister of war said to his adjutant, handing him the papers and still paying no attention to the courier.::19/8/2012
Southfield::648449.6213180642::“What can that be?” thought Rostov. “The enemy in the rear of our troops? It can’t be,” thought Rostov, and the terror of fear for himself and for the outcome of the whole battle suddenly came over him. “Whatever it may be, however,” he thought, “there’s no point now in going around. I must look for the commander in chief here, and if all is lost, then it’s my business to perish along with everybody.”::3/6/2002
Rock Hill::385550.7204743961::Natasha knew she must leave, but she could not do it: something clenched her throat, and she looked at Prince Andrei impolitely, directly, with wide-open eyes.::15/3/2000
North Springfield::795289.1878024286::A powdered old servant who was sitting in the waiting room got up with a quiet movement and in a whisper announced: “If you please.”::11/8/1930
Mantua::185709.10952189623::The regimental commander had so wanted to do that, he had been so sorry that he had had no time to do it, that it seemed to him that all this was exactly so. And perhaps it really was so? As if one could make out in that confusion what was and was not so?::25/8/1949
Turlock::290433.61535224575::“But we cannot wait, Prince, at such a moment. Pensez, il y va du salut de son &#226;me…Ah! c’est terrible, les devoirs d’un chr&#233;tien… ”†101::24/1/1953
Chatmoss::298798.6566821679::“The same hours, and the strolls in the avenues? The lathe?” asked Prince Andrei with a barely perceptible smile, which showed that, despite all his love and respect for his father, he was aware of his weaknesses.::9/11/1870
Decatur::97143.83581714514::“Tr&#232;s beau,”  the doctor said in reply to a question about the weather, “tr&#232;s beau, princesse, et puis, &#224; Moscou on se croit &#224; la campagne.” *116::19/10/1978
Bon Air::198586.4056109965::In 1852, he joined the army as a noncommissioned officer and served in Wallachia. Two years later he was promoted to ensign and was transferred at his own request to the Crimea, where he fought in the Crimean War and was present at the siege of Sevastopol. His Sevastopol Sketches,  which were published in 1855, made him famous in Petersburg social and literary circles. They were a second and fuller attempt at a true depiction of war.::25/6/1815
Prospect::667362.7995396205::Pierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of whom there were hundreds good-naturedly living out their lives in Moscow.::4/4/1899
New Britain::572272.221896641::Adieu, ch&#232;re et bonne amie, que notre divin Sauveur et sa tr&#232;s sainte M&#232;re vous aient en leur sainte et puissante garde.::15/11/1816
Carrsville::598571.0857027068::He cautiously withdrew the shoulder she was lying on, looked into her face, and carefully seated her in an armchair.::2/10/1887
Union Hall::519244.51871224877::“No matter how much mama begged her, she refused, and I know she won’t change once she’s said something…”::7/8/1864
Hurley::810857.8654540833::“An institution supportive of this honor, the source of competition, is an institution like the L&#233;gion d’honneur  of the great emperor Napoleon, which is not detrimental, but contributes to the success of the service, and not the privilege of rank or position at court.”::24/10/1997
Hartfield::84611.95280170385::“No, listen,” said Prince Andrei, stopping him by the arm. “Can you know what state I’m in? I must tell it all to somebody.”::25/12/1879
Apple Valley::871724.2135657816::Her brother often wondered, looking at her. It did not seem at all as if she was a loving fianc&#233;e separated from her future husband. She was level-headed, calm, altogether as cheerful as before. This surprised Nikolai, and it even made him look mistrustfully at this alliance with Bolkonsky. He did not believe that her fate was already decided, the less so as he had not seen her together with Prince Andrei. He kept thinking there was something wrong with this projected marriage.::23/11/1859
Austinville::45929.128449405885::“Yes, like a man, everything as it should be, and so he started, he started persuading her, and she should have kept him busy talking till cockcrow, but she got timid; she just got timid and covered her face with her hands. So he up and grabbed her. It’s a good thing the maids came running in right then…”::10/11/1932
Tasley::74275.67167212779::Mlle George, with bared, fat, dimpled arms, wearing a red shawl over one shoulder, came out into the empty space left for her among the chairs and stopped in an unnatural pose. Rapturous whispering was heard.::7/4/2009
Max Meadows::809027.9195754072::Everything fell silent again, but Prince Andrei knew that she was still sitting up there, he heard an occasional quiet stirring, an occasional sigh.::8/6/1874
Bismarck::909260.611181529::That smile said: “I’d be glad to rest and sit with you; I’m tired; but you see, I’ve been asked to dance, and I’m glad of it, and I’m happy, and I love everybody, and you and I understand all that,” and much, much more. When her partner left her, Natasha ran across the room to invite two ladies for the figures.::25/3/1839
Belmont Estates::418856.3777593649::Prince Andrei was becoming more and more animated. His eyes shone feverishly all the while he was trying to prove to Pierre that there never was any wish for his neighbor’s good in his action.::2/9/1867
Oakpark::894175.7269414332::“There was one, there was one like that,” the doctor said as if joyfully. “Must have died, but anyhow I’ll check, I had lists. Do you have them, Makeev?”::9/3/1932
Bellamy::594743.6637114543::“I have come by the will of the sovereign emperor to learn from Your Excellency what chances you intend to give to the memorandum submitted,” Prince Andrei said courteously.::16/9/1978
York Haven Anchorage::851371.5310501992::“Le vicomte a &#233;t&#233; personellement connu de monseigneur,”  Anna Pavlovna whispered to one. “Le vicomte est un parfait conteur,”  she said to another. “Comme on voit l’homme de la bonne compagnie,” †35 she said to a third; and the viscount was presented to the company in a most refined and advantageous light, like a roast beef on a hot platter sprinkled with herbs.::7/10/1801
Missoula::794264.7655467639::“Capital!” Prince Ippolit said in English and began slapping his knee with his palm. The viscount merely shrugged.::7/5/1920
Waukesha::676558.4927604574::“God be with us!” Bagration said in a firm, audible voice, turned for a moment to the front line, and, swinging his arms slightly, with the awkward gait of a cavalryman, as if working at it, he went forward over the uneven field. Prince Andrei felt that some invincible force was drawing him forward, and he experienced great happiness.*223::4/8/1897
Tuckahoe::402930.16225881205::“Supper, time for supper! The Gypsies are here!” Indeed, some dark-haired men and women, saying something with a Gypsy accent, were already coming in from the cold. Nikolai knew it was all over, but he said in an indifferent voice:::8/5/2018
Rancho Cordova::987254.8457086621::“Ah, good sir, what are you saying!” Pelageyushka said in horror, turning to Princess Marya for defense.::2/9/1958
Jefferson::824459.3309940713::“Countess, I am to blame before you,” Denisov went on in a halting voice. “But know that I adore your daughter and your whole family so much that I would give two lives…” He looked at the countess and, noticing her stern face…“Good-bye, Countess,” he said, kissed her hand, and, without looking at Natasha, with quick, resolute steps, left the room.::12/8/1923
Gulfport::119480.28842541392::“What makes me? I don’t know. I have to. Besides, I’m going…” He paused. “I’m going because this life I lead here, this life—is not for me!”::10/6/1879
Broadford::390495.6153851691::“But what makes you live? With such thoughts, you’ll sit without moving, without undertaking anything…”::23/9/1932
Gloucester Courthouse::165610.73335825917::“I know, dear, good princess,” said Anna Mikhailovna, seizing the portfolio with her hand and so firmly that it was clear she would not soon let go of it. “Dear princess, I beg you, I beseech you, have pity on him. Je vous en conjure… *140::2/12/1886
Wilsons::248294.16225091473::“I humbly thank you, Prince,” replied one of the officers, taking pleasure in conversing with such an important staff official. “An excellent place. We passed just by the park, saw two deer, and such a wonderful house!”::9/2/1838
Bentonville::893835.1232894527::“And I could be in his place!” Rostov thought to himself and, barely holding back tears of pity over the sovereign’s fate, rode on in complete despair, not knowing where he was going now or why.::2/8/1892
Lafayette::568811.5678879071::This was spoken by the short Bonaparte, looking from below straight into Alexander’s eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what was said to him and, inclining his head, smiled pleasantly.::20/2/1814
Lancaster::768170.3864191681::Across from Nikolai was a field of winter wheat, and there stood one of his hunters, alone, in a hollow behind an upthrust hazel bush. As soon as the hounds were loosed into the ravine, Nikolai heard the intermittent baying of a dog he knew—Voltorn; other dogs joined him, now falling silent, now giving tongue again. A moment later from the woods came a foxhunting cry, and the whole pack, joining together, went racing along the edge of the ravine in the direction of the field, away from Nikolai.::1/6/1825
Cave Spring::308984.018913533::“What orders, Your Excellency?” asked a protodeacon’s bass, hoarse from hallooing, and two black, brilliant eyes looked from under their brows at the silent master. “So you can’t stand it?” these two eyes seemed to say.::20/8/2007
Lauderhill::375272.4095954787::It was the second night that the two of them had not slept, looking after the boy, who was burning with fever. For two whole days, not trusting their house doctor and expecting the one they had sent for from town, they had been trying now one, now another remedy. Worn out by sleeplessness and anxiety, they shifted their grief onto each other, reproached each other, and quarreled.::4/2/1998
Vesuvius::435494.5924194793::Pierre, who was becoming more and more agitated during this conversation, got up and went over to the princess. He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was about to start crying himself.::23/1/2001
Flagstaff::49430.29343308891::On the eve of his departure from Petersburg, Prince Andrei brought along Pierre, who had not once been to the Rostovs’ since the time of the ball. Pierre looked perplexed and embarrassed. He was talking with the mother. Natasha sat down with Sonya by the chess table, thereby inviting Prince Andrei to join her. He went over to them.::10/5/1805
Wilmington::750268.135129881::“Why a blue greatcoat? Away!…Sergeant major! Have him changed…the dir…” He did not have time to finish.::13/2/1983
Center Cross::908176.4714172824::“Don’t think we’ll get in anybody’s way, uncle,” said Natasha. “We’ll stay in our places and not move.”::21/3/1879
Riverview::636705.0506569128::Kutuzov turned away without answering him, and his gaze chanced to rest on Prince Andrei, who was standing close by. Seeing Bolkonsky, Kutuzov softened the angry and caustic expression of his gaze, as if aware that his adjutant was not to blame for what was going on. And, without answering the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolkonsky:::7/3/1926
Gloucester Point::838120.6183038125::Dolgorukov, one of the most fervent advocates of the offensive, had just come back from the council, weary, exhausted, but animated and proud of the victory won. Prince Andrei introduced the officer he was patronizing, but Prince Dolgorukov, giving him a polite and firm handshake, said nothing to Boris and, obviously unable to keep from speaking out the thoughts that occupied him most at that moment, addressed Prince Andrei in French.::22/3/1806
Ararat::936095.9716072127::“Here I’ve got Pryanichnikov serving under me, a nice man, good as gold, but he’s sixty—is he going to take examinations?…”::7/4/2001
Alleghany::334487.31924079644::“Only, please, when I’m entertaining the guests,” said Vera, “don’t interrupt me, because I know how to entertain each of them and what to say in all kinds of company.”::23/6/1925
Pawtucket::950451.4553893338::From behind the door came the regular sounds of a lathe. The princess timidly pulled the easily and smoothly opening door and stopped in the doorway. The prince was working at the lathe and, having glanced at her, went on with what he was doing.::21/10/1959
Springfield::691599.8962794183::Old Prince Nikolai Andreich Bolkonsky received a letter from Prince Vassily in December 1805, informing him of his arrival together with his son. (“I am going to an inspection, and, of course, for me seventy miles is no detour if I can visit you, my much-esteemed benefactor,” he wrote, “and my Anatole is keeping me company on his way to the army; and I hope you will allow him personally to express the deep respect which he, in imitation of his father, has for you.”)::11/6/1801
Callands::926957.2756726032::He did not find Prince Andrei in Olm&#252;tz that day. But the sight of Olm&#252;tz, where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed and both emperors lived with their suites of courtiers and attendants, increased still more his desire to belong to that supreme world.::7/9/1839
Jolivue::983311.3751370793::“Good-bye, dear heart,” she said to the countess, who came to see her to the door; “wish me success,” she added in a whisper, so that her son would not hear.::11/11/2005
Nokesville::877142.0580418645::The day after his visit to Count Arakcheev, Prince Andrei went to a soir&#233;e at Count Kochubey’s. He told the count about his meeting with “Sila Andreich” (as Kochubey called Arakcheev, with that vague mockery of something which Prince Andrei had noticed in the minister of war’s anteroom).::14/1/1945
Cherry Hill::202412.15457845753::“If you please, Your Excellency, Petrusha has come with papers,” said one of the maids who assisted the nanny, addressing Prince Andrei, who was sitting on a child’s little chair, frowning, his hands trembling, pouring drops of medicine from a vial into a glass half filled with water.::6/8/1961
Horse Pasture::647228.5681994339::“Spring, and love, and happiness!” the oak seemed to say. “And how is it you’re not bored with the same stupid, senseless deception! Always the same, and always a deception! There is no spring, no sun, no happiness. Look, there sit those smothered, dead fir trees, always the same; look at me spreading my broken, flayed fingers wherever they grow—from my back, from my sides. As they’ve grown, so I stand, and I don’t believe in your hopes and deceptions.”::18/10/1824
Canton::139196.59804792263::“De Bal-mach&#232;ve!”  said the king (overcoming by his resoluteness the difficulty that the colonel was faced with), “charm&#233; de faire votre connaissance, g&#233;n&#233;ral,” ‡399 he added with a gesture of kingly graciousness. As soon as the king began to speak loudly and quickly, all his kingly dignity instantly left him, and, not noticing it himself, he went over to his proper tone of good-natured familiarity. He placed his hand on the withers of Balashov’s horse.::6/6/1914
Hollins::527869.9375848053::“Oui, mon cher, c’est une grande perte pour nous tous. Je ne parle pas de vous. Mais Dieu vous soutiendra, vous &#234;tes jeune et vous voil&#224; &#224; la t&#234;te d’une immense fortune, je l’esp&#232;re. Le testament n’a pas &#233;t&#233; encore ouvert. Je vous connais assez pour savoir que cela ne vous tournera pas la t&#234;te, mais cela vous impose des devoirs, et il faut &#234;tre homme.” ‡144::1/6/1962
Merrimac::928374.399498426::“If he’s a noble man, then he should either declare his intentions or stop seeing you; and if you don’t want to do it, I’ll do it; I’ll write to him and tell papa ,” Sonya said resolutely.::9/2/1913
Crimora::687305.565069015::Seeing Cossacks (les Cosaques)  on the other side and the spreading steppe (les Steppes),  in the middle of which lay Moscou la ville sainte, *393 capital of that state, similar to the Scythian state to which Alexander the Great had marched—Napoleon, unexpectedly for everyone, and contrary to both strategic and diplomatic considerations, ordered an advance, and the next day his troops started crossing the Niemen.::15/1/1877
Redlands::40356.876624926816::“But you’re still afraid,” the first, familiar voice went on. “Afraid of the unknown, that’s what. However much we say that the soul will go to heaven…we know that there is no heaven, but only atmosphere.”18::25/1/1965
Atlantic::795720.8547453256::Christmastime came and, besides the festal liturgy, besides the solemn and boring felicitations of the neighbors and the servants, besides the new dresses everybody put on, there was nothing special to mark it as Christmastime, yet in the windless twenty degrees of frost, in the bright, blinding sunlight of day and the starry winter light at night, one felt called upon to mark this time somehow.::2/1/1990
Lynwood::608294.2339265624::Dolokhov was holding the Englishman by the hand and clearly, distinctly articulating the terms of the bet, mainly addressing Anatole and Pierre.::1/12/1951
Bacova::302776.8198162818::The hussar only sighed, making no reply, and cleared his throat angrily. Down the line of hussars the hoofbeats of a trotting horse were heard, and suddenly out of the night mist, looking like a huge elephant, emerged the figure of a hussar sergeant.::14/12/1831
Chamberlayne::332078.5646040172::Natasha, tearing her face momentarily from her mother’s lace wrap, looked up at her through tears of laughter and hid her face again.::21/10/1849
Mount Vernon::135373.29571731327::Dolokhov slowly straightened his bent leg and looked the general directly in the face with his light and insolent gaze.::21/4/1896
Snowville::951266.4067911908::“Wait, he’s not drunk. Give me a bottle,” said Anatole, and taking a glass from the table, he went up to Pierre.::21/11/1909
Piney River::613242.3541742904::“Well, if it’s long, we can take it up, we can take it up in a minute,” said the resolute Dunyasha, taking a needle out of the fichu on her breast and setting to work again on the floor.::16/4/1933
Yorktown::606578.0988927509::“It’s ready, miss,” said the maid, lifting the taken-up gauze dress with two fingers, and shaking it and blowing at something, showing by this gesture an awareness of the airiness and purity of what she was holding.::8/11/1954
Lake Ridge::150367.39835800693::“Disposition for the attack on the enemy’s position behind Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz, 20 November 1805.”::10/3/2016
Pittsburg::886603.1407227439::Denisov slapped him on the shoulder and quickly began pacing the room without looking at Rostov, something he did in moments of inner turmoil.::18/4/1944
Passaic::333581.36619435565::Two witnesses—Khvostikov, a former clerk, whom Dolokhov made use of for gambling, and Makarin, a retired hussar, a kind-hearted and weak man, who had a boundless love for Kuragin—sat in the front room over tea.::18/1/1945
Harman::588080.1776451577::“We haven’t seen each other for long time,” he said. “Thank you for coming. Let me just finish the game, and Ilyushka will come with the chorus.”::14/4/1816
Caylor::538135.1535827622::“Au moins changez la coiffure,”  said the little princess. “Je vous disais,”  she said with reproach, turning to Mlle Bourienne, “Marie a une de ces figures, auxquelles ce genre de coiffure ne vas pas du tout. Mais du tout, du tout. Changez de gr&#226;ce.” §244::23/8/2004
Mathews::430110.334465414::“The master’s not at home, he’s gone to the staff,” Telyanin’s orderly told him. “Has something happened?” the orderly added, surprised to see the junker’s upset face.::20/10/1834
McMullin::698122.922572404::“What do I care about your allies?” said Napoleon. “I have the Poles for allies: there are eighty thousand of them, they fight like lions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them.”::22/5/1946
Loch Lomond::256341.2799476239::“Another superior just came, and he turned tail quickly,” the fireworker said to Prince Andrei, “not like Your Honor.”::16/12/1844
Riverdale::884564.2254923952::“Le Roi de Prusse…”  and again, as soon as they turned to him, he apologized and fell silent. Anna Pavlovna winced. Mortemart, Ippolit’s friend, addressed him resolutely:::12/11/1970
Cripple Creek::9009.941756295548::There was nothing bad or inappropriate in what they said, everything was witty and might have been funny; but that something which constitutes the salt of merriment was not only missing, but they did not even know it existed.::15/8/1803
Pasco::620478.5630658917::“Ils sont arriv&#233;s, Marie, *239 do you know?” said the little princess, waddling in with her belly and lowering herself heavily into an armchair.::2/7/1834
King and Queen Court House::814639.2432202753::Pierre hurriedly took out his purse, his watch, but for a long time could not get the wedding ring off his fat finger. When that was done, the Mason said:::13/5/1989
Riverton::798704.1839120451::Half an hour later the lined-up squadron was standing on the road. The command “Mount up!” rang out, the soldiers crossed themselves and began to mount up. Rostov, riding ahead, gave the command, “March!” and, stretching out four abreast, the hussars, with the sounds of hoofs splashing on the wet road, the clank of sabers, and quiet talk, started down the big, birch-lined road, in the wake of the preceding infantry and artillery.::24/8/1859
Frederick::193298.43466851383::“Captain Tushin’s, Your Excellency,” the red-haired, freckle-faced fireworker cried out in a merry voice, snapping to attention.::22/12/1886
Ruther Glen::833613.2930035223::The handsome young emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the horse guards, in a triangular hat, worn brim first, with his pleasant face and sonorous but not loud voice, attracted the full force of attention.::5/1/1901
Wolf Trap::641687.5859485455::“No, wait, Pierre. The princess is so good that she will not want to deprive me of the pleasure of spending an evening with you.”::15/12/1846
Weston::426485.6000347593::“You think so?…” said Anna Pavlovna, in order to say something, and again turned to her duties as mistress of the house, but Pierre committed the reverse discourtesy. Earlier he had walked away without hearing out a lady who was talking to him; now he held with his conversation a lady who needed to leave him. Lowering his head and spreading his big feet, he began to explain to Anna Pavlovna why he thought that the abb&#233;’s plan was a chimera.::3/4/1998
Independent Hill::724974.2039474699::Pelageya Danilovna, having ordered a space cleared for the guests and snacks served to the masters and servants, not removing her spectacles, with a suppressed smile, walked among the mummers, looking closely at their faces and not recognizing anybody. She not only did not recognize the Rostovs or Dimmler, but she could not recognize her own daughters, or her husband’s robes and uniforms, which they were wearing.::18/12/1980
North Richland Hills::918127.8607589952::“Yes, we know, but what I know as evil for myself, I cannot do to another person,” Prince Andrei was speaking more and more animatedly, clearly wishing to voice his new view of things to Pierre. He spoke in French. “Je ne connais dans la vie que deux maux bien r&#233;els: c’est le remords et la maladie. Il n’est de bien que l’absence de ces maux. *315 To live for myself, only avoiding these two evils—that is all my wisdom now.”::1/8/1957
Maple Grove::91032.8233158919::In general, the main feature that struck Prince Andrei in Speransky’s mind was his unquestionable, unshakeable faith in the power and legitimacy of reason. It was clear that the notion, so usual for Prince Andrei, that it was after all impossible to express everything one thinks, would never have entered Speransky’s head, and it never occurred to him to wonder: “Isn’t everything I think and believe sheer nonsense?” And that special cast of Speransky’s mind attracted Prince Andrei most of all.::12/5/2015
Kissimmee::600411.799204037::Prince Andrei always became especially animated when he had to guide a young man and help him towards worldly success. Under the pretext of this help for another, which out of pride he would never accept for himself, he found himself close to the milieu which conferred success and which attracted him. He took up Boris quite willingly and went with him to Prince Dolgorukov.::20/8/2002
Union City::730264.9168474686::“Oh! it’s terrible to feel myself so much in this man’s power,” thought Rostov. Rostov knew what a blow he would deal to his father, to his mother, in announcing this loss; he knew what happiness it would be to be delivered of it all, and he realized that Dolokhov knew he could deliver him from this shame and grief, but still wanted to play with him as a cat plays with a mouse.::22/3/1997
Shadwell::659741.1786082209::But before he finished saying it, Prince Andrei, feeling sobs of shame and anger rising in his throat, was already jumping off his horse and running towards the standard.::25/3/1807
Saint Charles::28828.01694918302::The next day the troops set out on the march, and Boris had no time up to the battle of Austerlitz itself to visit either Bolkonsky or Dolgorukov and remained for a time with the Izmailovsky regiment.::3/11/1911
Highland Acres::352705.7904431962::“Ah, I’m so happy,” she replied, smiling through her tears, leaned closer to him, thought for a second, as if asking herself whether she could, and kissed him.::21/8/1856
Walnut Creek::958222.6207408512::From behind the hut came the rolling shout of Denisov, obviously in a fit of temper. Rostov moved to the window to see whom he was dealing with, and saw Sergeant Major Topcheenko.::14/3/2008
South Jordan::148754.52344919514::“Ma ch&#232;re, il y a un temps pour tout,” *86 said the countess, feigning sternness. “You always spoil her, &#201;lie ,” she added to her husband.::14/2/1874
Talleyville::692666.3634687614::“You’ll never understand it,” she said, turning to Vera, “because you’ve never loved anybody, you have no heart, you’re just a Madame de Genlis” (this nickname, considered very offensive, had been given to Vera by Nikolai), “and your highest pleasure is to do unpleasant things to others. Go and flirt with Berg as much as you like,” she said quickly.::25/9/1970
Rising Sun::232551.10871234487::There was a ringing of bells; the club stewards rushed forward; scattered through different rooms, the guests, like rye shaken in a shovel, came together in one heap and stopped in the big drawing room by the door to the reception hall.::10/6/1953
Muncie::196198.19659197502::“Me tried for robbery—ach! Give me more water—let them try me, but I’ll beat the scoundrels, I’ll always beat them, and I’ll tell the sovereign. Give me ice,” he kept murmuring.::19/12/1988
Roseville Park::301852.4699040428::“But there’s a difference between not acknowledging him as emperor and calling him General Buonaparte,” said Bolkonsky.::10/6/1959
Cedar Park::251281.38193517624::“Qui vivra verra,” **202 said Bilibin, again releasing his skin as a sign that the conversation was over.::13/5/2004
Woodbury::85554.52893536097::“Don’t call him bad,” said Natasha. “But I don’t know, I don’t know anything…” She began to cry again.::9/7/1956
Stanton::309293.5334233514::“Ah, it’s you, very glad, very glad to see you,” he said anyhow, smiling and going up to him. But Rostov had noticed his first reaction.::14/12/1896
Holly Oak::41190.76348540784::The old count, knowing his son’s hunting ardor, hurried so as not to be late, and before the kennelmen managed to reach their places, Ilya Andreich, merry, red-cheeked, with quivering jowls, drove up with his black horses across the green winter wheat to the covert left for him, and having straightened his fur jacket and put on his hunting gear, mounted his sleek, well-fed, placid, and kind Viflyanka, gone as gray as himself. The horses and droshky were sent away.::4/7/1819
Christiana::950293.3891489126::“And what secrets can there be at your age between Natasha and Boris and between you two? It’s all silliness!”::21/9/2015
Palatine::438989.8047242252::“Sonya!” she said suddenly, as if guessing the real reason for her cousin’s distress. “Vera must have talked with you after dinner? Did she?”::24/1/1923
Bossier City::721833.2598414234::A still greater feeling of pity, tenderness, and love took hold of Pierre. He felt tears flowing behind his spectacles and hoped they would not be noticed.::23/2/1831
Saint Georges::43280.24560246546::Mikhail Ivanovich, who had no idea when this you and I had spoken such words about Bonaparte, but who understood that he was needed in order to launch into the favorite subject, looked at the young prince in surprise, not knowing what would come of it.::17/11/1918
Edgemoor::443676.462311091::Across from Nikolai was a field of winter wheat, and there stood one of his hunters, alone, in a hollow behind an upthrust hazel bush. As soon as the hounds were loosed into the ravine, Nikolai heard the intermittent baying of a dog he knew—Voltorn; other dogs joined him, now falling silent, now giving tongue again. A moment later from the woods came a foxhunting cry, and the whole pack, joining together, went racing along the edge of the ravine in the direction of the field, away from Nikolai.::18/9/1913
Dothan::360547.197484731::As soon as the uhlans had gone down the hill, the hussars were ordered to move up the hill to cover the battery. While the hussars took the place of the uhlans, bullets came flying from the front line, whining and whistling, missing their aim by far.::11/8/2019
Ogletown::884688.4870586301::“No, I’m perfect, perfect. I feel so good,” Natasha said, even with perplexity. They were silent for a long time.::6/1/1920
Mount Vernon::128845.98214011734::Nikolai, who wanted to give everyone a ride over the excellent road in his troika, suggested that they take a dozen or so of the dressed-up servants and go to their uncle’s.::21/2/1824
Eau Claire::58419.77602413961::“I am an admirer of Montesquieu,” said Prince Andrei. “And his thought that ‘le principe des monarchies est l’honneur’ me para&#238;t incontestable. Certains droits et privil&#232;ges de la noblesse me paraissent &#234;tre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment. ”*339::10/1/1897
Yorba Linda::808506.8911021542::“Yes, nice, nice children,” agreed the count, who always resolved all tangled questions by finding everything nice. “Just look at him! Decided to be a hussar! Well, what do you want, ma ch&#232;re !”::18/6/2016
Davis::468778.47725685127::“Why no, not in the least,” said Boris. “But if you’re tired, let’s go to my room, and you can lie down to rest.”::5/10/1913
Homestead::161223.563730572::The postilion touched up the horses, and the wheels of the carriage rumbled. Prince Ippolit laughed fitfully, standing on the porch and waiting for the viscount, whom he had promised to take home.::21/6/1888
Brookside::566816.3955011001::“And has papa aged?” she asked. Natasha sat down and, without entering into the conversation between Boris and the countess, silently studied her childhood wooer in the minutest detail. He felt the weight of that persistent and affectionate gaze upon him and glanced at her from time to time.::13/10/1891
Marshallton::214736.44672111937::Returning from his southern journey in the happiest state of mind, Pierre carried out a long-standing intention of his—to go and visit his friend Bolkonsky, whom he had not seen for two years.::6/6/1800
Waterloo::87489.97477520714::At the beginning of 1806, Nikolai Rostov came home on leave. Denisov also went home to Voronezh, and Rostov persuaded him to come with him as far as Moscow and stay in their house. At the next to last posting station, Denisov met a friend, drank three bottles of wine with him, and, despite the bumps of the road, did not wake up all the way, lying on the bottom of the horse-drawn sleigh beside Rostov, who became more and more impatient the closer they came to Moscow.::19/1/1847

Westover Hills::51610.74244027131::Princess Marya told Pierre that she planned, as soon as the Rostovs arrived, to become close with her future sister-in-law and to try to get the old prince used to her.::19/6/1822
Gaithersburg::228032.90401644484::Julie was especially affectionate with Boris: she was sorry for his early disappointment in life, offering him what consolations of friendship she could offer, having suffered so much in life herself, and she opened her album for him.8 Boris drew two trees in her album and wrote: “Arbres rustiques, vos sombres rameaux secouent sur moi les t&#233;n&#232;bres et la m&#233;lancolie.” †367::17/11/1892

Centerville::990607.2827892851::Those who were in the dimly lit room talked together in broken whispers, and fell silent each time, turning with eyes full of inquiry and expectation to the door which led to the dying man’s room and which made a faint noise whenever someone went in or came out.::22/9/1805
Saint Cloud::452444.66010264505::The stately figure of Nesvitsky, accompanied by the Cossack, and the resoluteness of Denisov, waving his saber and shouting desperately, had such an effect that they pushed through to the other end of the bridge and stopped the infantry. At the exit Nesvitsky found the colonel to whom he was to give the order, and, having fulfilled his mission, rode back again.::17/10/1849
Holloway Terrace::352050.179631472::He saw the whippers-in in their red hats riding along the edge of the overgrown ravine; he even saw the dogs, and expected every second that a fox would appear on the other side, on the green field.::2/1/1983
Marysville::643014.9452299341::“What about him? A madcap…doesn’t want to listen. Well, there’s no point talking, we’ve worn the poor girl out as it is,” said Marya Dmitrievna. “And my advice to you is to finish your business and go home to Otradnoe…and wait there…”::17/4/1952
Minquadale::4858.349214134861::“A future life?” Prince Andrei repeated, but Pierre gave him no time to reply, and took this repetition for a denial, the more so as he knew Prince Andrei’s former atheistic convictions.::4/4/1976
Greenville::52497.485809914535::On the evening of the same day, an animated conversation was going on among the squadron officers in Denisov’s quarters.::14/6/1831
Delray Beach::294117.4769546495::In the front hall the outside door opened, someone asked, “Are they at home?” and someone’s footsteps were heard. Natasha was looking in the mirror, but did not see herself. She was listening to the sounds in the front hall. When she did see herself, her face was pale. It was he.  She knew it for certain, though she had barely heard the sound of his voice through the closed door.::17/10/1827
Rockland::736242.2944758127::“Only not late, Count, if I may ask; around ten minutes to eight, if I may ask. We’ll have a game of cards. Our general will join us. He’s very kind to me. We’ll have supper, Count. So do me the favor.”::22/8/1947
Camarillo::396920.2124157555::The lieutenant never looked the person he was talking to in the eye; his eyes constantly shifted from one object to another.::5/4/1926
Montchanin::658793.5970542328::Balashov rode on, supposing from Murat’s words that he would quite soon be introduced to Napoleon himself. But instead of meeting Napoleon soon, he was detained by sentinels of Davout’s infantry corps at the next village, as he had been at the front line, and the summoned adjutant of the corps commander took him to the village to Marshal Davout.::3/2/1845
Georgetown::596802.0078280208::And the loquacious Dolgorukov, turning now to Boris, now to Prince Andrei, told how Bonaparte, wishing to test Mark&#243;v, our ambassador, purposely dropped his handkerchief in front of him and stood there looking at him, probably expecting a service from Mark&#243;v, and how Mark&#243;v at once dropped his own handkerchief next to it and picked it up, without picking up Bonaparte’s handkerchief.::24/7/1809
Kent Acres::585775.8430681134::He was happy with the gratitude shown him, but ashamed as he received it. This gratitude reminded him how much more  he could do for these simple, good people.::20/6/1803
Pleasantville::198706.61522061127::“So there is what and whom to be sorry for—human dignity, peace of conscience, purity, and not their backs and heads, which, however much you whip them and shave them, will still remain the same backs and heads.”::5/4/1866
Kenner::928233.8309034377::“You see, my most gentle sir, I have read your memorandum,” Arakcheev interrupted, speaking only the first words benignly, again without looking him in the face and lapsing more and more into a grumblingly contemptuous tone. “Proposing new military regulations? There are many regulations, and no one to carry out the old ones. Everybody writes regulations these days; it’s easier to write them than to follow them.”::4/3/1906
Palo Alto::70693.53556509838::Sitting in the drawing room and listening to this talk and gossip among the old men, Princess Marya understood nothing of what she heard; she was thinking only of whether the guests had noticed her father’s hostile attitude towards her. She did not even notice the special attention and courtesy shown her during that dinner by Drubetskoy, who was already visiting their house for the third time.::20/7/1946
Jackson::332381.9467294561::But the colonel did not finish everything he wanted to say. A cannonball flew close to him and made him duck and crouch down on his horse. He fell silent and was about to say something more when another cannonball stopped him. He turned his horse and galloped away.::20/7/1821
Greenville::794593.9685617595::“What’s wrong, dear,” she said crossly to the girl, who made her wait a few minutes. “You don’t want to serve me? Then I’ll find another place for you, miss.”::21/4/1919
Pike Creek Valley::312833.796998368::“Sonya!” she said suddenly, as if guessing the real reason for her cousin’s distress. “Vera must have talked with you after dinner? Did she?”::8/6/1930
South San Francisco::636360.8760200695::“He is minister of war, the sovereign emperor’s trusted man; his personal qualities are nobody’s business; he was entrusted with considering my memorandum—consequently, he alone can set it in motion,” thought Prince Andrei, waiting among many significant and insignificant persons in Count Arakcheev’s anteroom.::18/6/2007
Hockessin::540552.6860430931::Dolokhov did not answer his company commander; he was involved in a heated argument with the French grenadier. They were talking, as they could only have been, about the campaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, insisted that the Russians had surrendered and fled all the way from Ulm. Dolokhov insisted that the Russians had not surrendered, but had beaten the French.::13/6/1919
Rockville::701535.1889015557::At the beginning of winter, Prince Nikolai Andreich Bolkonsky came to Moscow with his daughter. Because of his past, because of his intelligence and originality, and especially because of the weakening just then of the raptures over the reign of Alexander I, and because of the anti-French and patriotic tendencies which reigned at that time in Moscow, Prince Nikolai Andreich at once became an object of special deference among the Muscovites and the center of Moscow opposition to the government.::17/9/1855
Portland::498150.26655149466::“I’m not saying that this is a plan I approve of,” the son said, “I’ve only told you what’s in it. Napoleon has already put together a plan no worse than this one.”::19/5/1900
Collins Park::875941.0065901302::“With that I must observe, Your Excellency,” he went on, remembering Dolokhov’s conversation with Kutuzov and his own last encounter with the demoted soldier, “that the demoted private Dolokhov, before my eyes, took a French officer prisoner and particularly distinguished himself.”::1/6/1990
Yuba City::871854.080303471::“Only fools and profligates can be unwell, my boy, and you know me: I’m busy from morning till evening, I’m temperate, and so I’m well.”::17/1/2004
Bowers Beach::661902.9018739226::“Well, little countess, right you are!” the uncle said, laughing joyfully, finishing the dance. “What a niece! Now all we need is to choose you a fine young fellow for a husband, right you are!”::25/11/2016
Johnson City::354642.33785627433::“No, dear heart,” spoke a pleasant voice, which seemed familiar to Prince Andrei, “I say that if it were possible to know what there will be after death, none of us would be afraid of death. That’s so, dear heart.”::5/4/1920
Fairfax::627866.6850686534::Nikolai Rostov experienced this blessedness to the full as he continued serving after 1807 in the Pavlogradsky regiment, where he was already a squadron commander, having taken over from Denisov.::15/5/1989
Wilmington Manor::56869.45800877119::Denisov, chewing his mustache, was listening to the conversation with a gloomy air, apparently unwilling to enter into it. To the staff captain’s question he shook his head negatively.::8/8/1962
Lebanon::820254.559192304::The under-officer, frowning and muttering some abuse, thrust his horse’s breast towards Balashov, took hold of his saber, and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking him if he was deaf and had not heard what he was told. Balashov gave his name. The under-officer sent a soldier for an officer.::12/12/1873
Daytona Beach::413707.8069930978::Rostov fearfully began to justify himself, but seeing the general’s good-naturedly joking face, led him aside and in an agitated voice told him the whole affair, begging the general to intercede for Denisov, whom he knew. The general listened to Rostov, shaking his head gravely.::18/10/1927
Oshkosh::50455.94622634741::The countess was upset by her friend’s woes and humiliating poverty, and was therefore out of sorts, which always expressed itself in her calling the maid “dear” and “miss.”::21/9/1832
Broomfield::562847.994521479::“Well, now to the health of beautiful women,” said Dolokhov, and with a serious expression, but with a smile at the corners of his mouth, he turned to Pierre, glass in hand. “To the health of beautiful women, Petrusha, and of their lovers,” he said.::1/6/1822
Eagan::828321.7480276842::A minute later the marshal’s adjutant, M. de Castries, came in and led Balashov to the lodgings prepared for him.::1/5/1817
North Little Rock::605392.7180270426::She evidently forgot her age and employed, out of habit, all her old feminine resources. But as soon as he left, her face again acquired the same cold, sham expression it had had before. She went back to the circle, where the viscount was going on with his story, and again pretended to listen, waiting for the moment to leave, since her business was done.::18/3/1821
Bayonne::854775.90812105::Prince Andrei, having washed and dressed, came out to the diplomat’s luxurious study and sat down to the prepared dinner. Bilibin settled comfortably by the fireplace.::15/4/1810
Ames::551865.6579473504::“I just called on the countess, your spouse, and was so unlucky as to have my request go unfulfilled; I hope that with you, Count, I shall have more luck,” he said, smiling.::14/5/1908
Glasgow::886273.0022210984::Here Prince Ippolit snorted and guffawed, far in advance of his listeners, which produced an impression unfavorable to the narrator. Many smiled, however, the elderly lady and Anna Pavlovna among them.::13/4/1871
Mansfield::700815.4282041539::A bottle of rum was brought. Two lackeys were tearing out the frame that prevented one from sitting on the outer ledge of the window; they were obviously hurrying and intimidated by the orders and shouts of the surrounding gentlemen.::21/1/1867
Harlingen::241712.2622502421::She evidently forgot her age and employed, out of habit, all her old feminine resources.

Bear::709966.6721612167::“What am I to do?” he said finally. “You know, I did all a father could for their upbringing, and they both turned out des imb&#233;ciles.  Ippolit is at least an untroublesome fool, but Anatole is a troublesome one. That’s the only difference,” he said, smiling more unnaturally and animatedly than usual, and with that showing especially clearly in the wrinkles that formed around his mouth something unexpectedly coarse and disagreeable.::14/9/1941
Milford Crossroads::520631.04443859553::“And still the only thing I love and cherish is triumph over all of them, I cherish that mysterious power and glory hovering over me here in this mist!”::18/9/1802
San Clemente::628930.7936001216::“Ah, enough, please, as if you could come at the wrong time,” said Boris. He led him into the room, where the supper table had been laid, introduced him to his guests, giving his name and explaining that he was not a civilian, but a hussar officer and his old friend. “Count Zhilinsky, le comte N. N., le capitaine S. S., ” he named his guests. Rostov looked frowningly at the Frenchmen, made his bows reluctantly, and said nothing.::9/1/1937
Rodney Village::836694.8324772344::“No, not for anything, I’ll do it, and you go and listen at the door.” And Natasha ran across the drawing room to the reception room, where Denisov was sitting on the same chair at the clavichord, covering his face with his hands. At the sound of her light footsteps, he jumped up.::4/6/1945
Conway::517369.7607994647::After his talk with his wife, Pierre went to Petersburg. At the Torzhok posting station there were no horses, or else the postmaster did not want to give them to him. Pierre had to wait. Without undressing, he lay down on a leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big feet in their warm boots on the table, and lapsed into thought.::9/4/1917

Tamarac::784027.8472285966::“But how can you live for yourself alone?” asked Pierre, becoming heated. “What about your son, your sister, your father?”::8/10/2001
Shawnee::92368.54014578521::The squadron in which Rostov served had just had time to mount its horses when it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as on the Enns bridge, there was no one between the squadron and the enemy, and there lay between them, separating them, that same terrible line of the unknown and of fear, like the line separating the living from the dead. All the men sensed that line, and the question of whether they would or would not cross that line, and how they would cross it, troubled them.::12/11/1919
Rogers::43861.39206779527::A tall, beautiful lady entered the neighboring box, with an enormous braid and very bared, white, full shoulders and neck, on which hung a double string of big pearls. She took a long time to settle herself, rustling her heavy silk gown.::19/2/1827
Schenectady::820404.1301305055::“De l’histoire ancienne,”  said a third, realizing that the talk was about former wars. “L’Empereur va lui faire voir &#224; votre Souvara, comme les autres…” †220::24/10/1896
East Orange::835084.4520503645::Dolokhov, now changed into a gray soldier’s greatcoat, did not wait to be called out. The trim figure of the fair-haired soldier with clear blue eyes stepped from the line. He went up to the commander in chief and presented arms.::7/7/1915
Lodi::889179.0055165365::“There’s nothing for me to understand!” Natasha cried with stubborn willfulness. “He’s wicked and unfeeling. I do like your Denisov, and he’s a carouser and all that, but even so I like him, which means I understand. I don’t know how to tell you; he has it all calculated, and I don’t like that. But Denisov…”::13/3/1844
Buckeye::571896.3593388771::“Gentlemen,” he said, after keeping the bank for a while, “I ask you to put your money on your cards, otherwise I may get confused in the accounting.”::4/3/1945
West Des Moines::429719.4267697468::Across from Nikolai was a field of winter wheat, and there stood one of his hunters, alone, in a hollow behind an upthrust hazel bush. As soon as the hounds were loosed into the ravine, Nikolai heard the intermittent baying of a dog he knew—Voltorn; other dogs joined him, now falling silent, now giving tongue again. A moment later from the woods came a foxhunting cry, and the whole pack, joining together, went racing along the edge of the ravine in the direction of the field, away from Nikolai.::17/4/1943
Santa Cruz::761865.350622442::“It’s cleverly written, there’s no saying it’s not,” said Tushin. “But that’s not the point, Vassily Dmitrich,” he also turned to Rostov, “a man ought to submit, but Vassily Dmitrich here doesn’t want to. The auditor told you your case was going badly.”::25/5/1894
Yorklyn::867807.343082966::The gray-haired valet sat dozing and listening to the prince’s snoring in the immense study. From the far side of the house, from behind a closed door, came the sounds of a Dusek sonata,45 the difficult passages repeated twenty times.::24/7/2015
Madera::371574.88145067444::He spoke that refined French in which our grandparents not only spoke but thought, and with those quiet, patronizing intonations which are proper to a significant man who has grown old in society and at court. He went over to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting her with his perfumed and shining bald pate, and settled comfortably on the sofa.::21/5/1978
Long Neck::252774.60058090594::When Rostov came back, there was a bottle of vodka and some sausage on the table. Denisov was sitting at the table scratching on a piece of paper with his quill. He glanced darkly at Rostov’s face.::11/10/1910

Youngstown::636246.0624590111::“How she loves me!” thought Princess Marya. “How happy I am now, and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Can it be—a husband?” she thought, not daring to look up at his face, still feeling that same gaze directed at her.::14/3/1826
Ixonia::142846.90375236352::“Whatever misfortune there may be,” Prince Andrei went on, “I beg you, Mademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, turn to him alone for advice and help. He’s the most absentminded and ridiculous man, but he has a heart of gold.”::9/2/1999
North Port::684984.4357632729::Princess Marya looked at him with astonishment. She did not understand how it was even possible to ask about it. Pierre went into the study.

Summit Corners::273171.1946800713::“Ha, ha, ha!…That hussar, that hussar! Just like a boy, and the legs!…I can’t stand it!…” voices said.::17/2/2011
Skokie::668420.6405941299::“Why do you say that?” said Princess Marya. “Why do you say that now, when you’re going to this terrible war, and he’s so old! Mlle Bourienne said he asked about you…” As soon as she began to speak of it, her lips trembled and tears began to fall. Prince Andrei turned away from her and started pacing the room.::19/10/1977

Cheyenne::245013.34484659077::“Can it be me, that ‘baby girl’ (as everybody said of me),” thought Natasha, “can it be that from this moment on I’m a wife,  equal to this strange, dear, intelligent man, whom even my father respects? Can it be true? Can it be true that now there is to be no more toying with life, that I’m grown up now, that responsibility is laid upon me now for my every deed and word? Ah, what was it he asked me?”::24/5/1860
Eden Prairie::961593.0921576781::Everything fell silent again, but Prince Andrei knew that she was still sitting up there, he heard an occasional quiet stirring, an occasional sigh.::10/7/1928
Wellington::236443.83878623697::“No help for it! It happens to everybody,” his son said in a careless, brazen tone, while in his soul he considered himself a villain, a scoundrel, whose whole life would not be enough to redeem his crime. He would have liked to kiss his father’s hands, to go to his knees and ask forgiveness, yet he said in a careless and even rude tone that it happened to everybody.::23/9/2015
Gotham::376798.75745667267::“Let me…be…what do I…I’ll…die…” she said, freed herself from Marya Dmitrievna with an angry thrust, and lay in her former position.::7/12/1847

South Range::395081.66930920584::There are two sides to each man’s life: his personal life, which is the more free the more abstract its interests, and his elemental, swarmlike life, where man inevitably fulfills the laws prescribed for him.::22/11/1949

Montebello::906908.4685579699::“O-one! Two! Three!…” Denisov cried out angrily and stepped aside. The two men began walking over the imprinted tracks, getting closer and closer, and recognizing each other in the fog. The adversaries had the right to fire at any time while coming to the barrier. Dolokhov walked slowly, without raising his pistol, his light, shining blue eyes peering into his adversary’s face. On his mouth there was, as usual, the semblance of a smile.::13/1/1881

Waltham::524671.5401807067::Having drawn even with the infantry guards, he noticed that cannonballs were flying over and around them, not so much because he heard the sound of the cannon, but because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers’ faces, and on the officers’ an unnatural military solemnity.::18/3/2002
McAllister::794388.7084112216::Kochubey said a few words about the reception Arakcheev had given Bolkonsky. Speransky’s smile widened.::7/5/2003

Pell Lake::283131.0831646808::“Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. You know, it’s the famous Prince Bolkonsky,9 already retired under the late emperor and nicknamed ‘the King of Prussia.’ He’s a very intelligent man, but an odd and difficult one. La pauvre petite est malheureuse comme les pierres. #22 She has a brother, Kutuzov’s adjutant, the one who recently married Lise Meinen. He’ll come tonight.”::25/7/1920

Council Bluffs::68453.68029123289::The halted infantry soldiers, crowding in the trampled mud by the bridge, gazed at the clean, foppish hussars going past them in order, with that special feeling of ill will, alienation, and mockery with which different branches of the military usually meet each other.::9/4/1874
Black Hawk::514083.20248005714::“N-no,” Dolokhov said through his teeth, “no, it’s not over,” and, taking several more dipping, hobbling steps to the sword, he fell on the snow beside it. His left hand was bloody; he wiped it on his coat and propped himself up with it. His face was pale, frowning, and trembled.::3/7/1971
Gibbsville::978556.9841289594::Anna Pavlovna all but closed her eyes as a sign that neither she nor anyone else could judge of the empress’s good pleasure or liking.::9/6/1902
Pine River::567272.0412745832::“Capital!” Prince Ippolit said in English and began slapping his knee with his palm. The viscount merely shrugged.::17/9/1965
Redmond::651539.4288284646::“There was one, there was one like that,” the doctor said as if joyfully. “Must have died, but anyhow I’ll check, I had lists. Do you have them, Makeev?”::14/9/1802
Whittlesey::290569.66023588215::Though Prince Vassily listened to the elderly lady reluctantly and almost impolitely, and even showed impatience, she smiled at him gently and touchingly, and even took him by the arm to keep him from walking away.::5/9/1861
Coon Rapids::192856.24898384136::Dolokhov, now changed into a gray soldier’s greatcoat, did not wait to be called out. The trim figure of the fair-haired soldier with clear blue eyes stepped from the line. He went up to the commander in chief and presented arms.::7/12/1904
North Miami::764435.6669349818::For two days after that, Rostov did not see Dolokhov at his house and could not find him at home; on the third day, he received a note from him.::24/10/1880
Sugar Bush::365420.83732070285::“No, you haven’t understood me,” said his mother, not knowing how to justify herself. “You haven’t understood me, Nikolenka. I wish for your happiness,” she added, and felt that she was not speaking the truth, that she was confused. She began to cry.::1/3/1845
Salem Lakes::25396.44229388216::“Attendez, je n’ai pas fini…”  he said to Prince Andrei, seizing him by the arm. “Je suppose que l’intervention sera plus forte que la non-intervention. Et…”  He paused. “On ne pourra pas imputer &#224; la fin de nonrecevoir notre d&#233;p&#234;che du 28 novembre. Voil&#224; comment tout cela finira.” †205::14/2/1879

Hamilton::603494.8816009309::The rumor that had already spread earlier about the defeat of the Austrians and the surrender of the entire army at Ulm turned out to be true. Within half an hour adjutants had been sent out in various directions with orders demonstrating that the Russian troops, so far inactive, would soon also have to meet the enemy.::9/8/1919
Hannibal::30255.06435577685::“Laissez-moi, laissez-moi, tout &#231;a m’est parfaitement &#233;gal,” #245 answered a voice barely holding back its tears.::2/5/1840
Rowlett::238923.32392217364::“To enter Russia without a declaration of war. I will make peace only when not a single armed enemy remains on my soil,” he said. It seemed to Boris that the sovereign enjoyed uttering these words: he was pleased with the form in which he had expressed his thought, but displeased that Boris had overheard it.::11/1/1824
San Marcos::284232.6703500152::In the eyes of the world, Pierre was a great lord, the somewhat blind and ridiculous husband of a famous wife, an intelligent eccentric, a do-nothing, but one who harmed nobody, a nice and kind fellow. Yet in Pierre’s soul all that time a complex and difficult work of inner development was taking place, which revealed much to him and led him to many spiritual doubts and joys.::23/11/1997
Lakeville::561006.5026151874::“Why ask me? General Armfelt has suggested a beautiful position, with an exposed rear. Or the attack von diesem italienischen Herrn, sehr sch&#246;n! *422 Or a retreat. Auch gut. †423 Why ask me?” he said. “You yourselves know everything better than I.” But when Volkonsky, frowning, said that he was asking his opinion on behalf of the sovereign, Pfuel stood up and, suddenly animated, began to speak:::14/9/1805
Lake Beulah::587723.7552253483::“I know,” Bilibin interrupted, “you think it’s very easy to capture marshals while sitting on a sofa in front of a fireplace. That’s true, but even so, why didn’t you capture him? And don’t be surprised if not only the minister of war, but the most august emperor and king Franz is not made very happy by your victory; nor do I, a miserable secretary of the Russian embassy, feel any particular joy…”::6/8/1821
Kempster::152705.94201737497::The cries and fires in the enemy army came from the fact that, while Napoleon’s orders were being read to the troops, the emperor himself rode around his bivouacs. The soldiers, seeing the emperor, set fire to bundles of straw and ran after him, shouting, “Vive l’empereur!”  Napoleon’s orders were the following:::18/4/1820
Springfield::923039.0260308688::As if by the sounds of the most cheerful music, Rostov felt cheered at heart by these sounds, which he had not heard for so long. Trap-ta-ta-tap!—several shots clapped out, now together, now in rapid succession. Then all fell silent, and then came the crackling again, as if someone was walking on firecrackers.::15/4/2004
Grand Junction::946125.09571015::“Yerzinka! Dearie!” wailed Ilagin in a voice not his own. Yerza did not heed his prayer. At the very moment she was expected to seize the hare, he swerved and flew out to the boundary between the green fields and the stubble. Again Yerza and Milka, like a team of horses, straightened up and sped after the hare; it was easier for him to run along the boundary, and dogs could not close in on him so quickly.::13/5/1934
La Habra::85521.57979096098::“No, dear heart.” (The count was also embarrassed. He felt he had managed his wife’s estate poorly and was guilty before his children, but he did not know how to set things to rights.) “No, I ask you to take care of things, I’m old, I…”::10/2/2012
Larsen::945206.6277069895::From all these parties, one more, the ninth party, emerged and began to raise its voice just as Prince Andrei came to the army. This was a party of older people, intelligent, experienced in statesmanship, and who were able, without sharing any of these contradictory opinions, to look at everything that went on at headquarters abstractly, and to reflect on the means of getting out of this uncertainty, irresolution, confusion, and weakness.::8/7/1848
Moore::159863.47306507675::And the regimental commander, reflected as in a mirror, invisibly to himself, in the hussar officer, bounced, came forward, and replied:::8/10/1963
Burnsville::120197.48186400914::“I’m glad I’ve spoken it all out. Maybe it’s unpleasant for you, you must excuse me,” he said, reassuring Pierre instead of being reassured by him, “but I hope I haven’t offended you.

Taylor::349936.80862983514::The magnificent reception room was filled. Everyone rose deferentially when the commander in chief, having spent about half an hour alone with the sick man, came out, responding slightly to the bows and trying to go quickly past the looks that doctors, clergymen, and relations directed at him. Prince Vassily, grown thin and pale during those days, accompanied the commander in chief and quietly repeated something to him several times.::1/6/1811
Powers Lake::414678.6250268674::“Catiche a fait donner du th&#233; dans le petit salon,”  Prince Vassily said to Anna Mikhailovna. “Allez, ma pauvre  Anna Mikhailovna, prenez quelque chose, autrement vous ne suffirez pas .” †137::17/2/1953
Eastvale::457360.96001797565::Prince Ippolit hastily put on his redingote, which, in the new style, hung lower than his heels, and, tangling himself in it, ran to the porch after the princess, whom the footman was helping into the carriage.::18/7/1887
National City::913476.6198064229::Natasha did not allow her to finish, pulled the countess’s big hand towards her and kissed it on the back, then on the palm, then turned it again and began to kiss it on one knuckle, then in between, then on the next knuckle, murmuring in a whisper: “January, February, March, April, May.”::3/11/1886
Lehi::902447.9498950284::“The master’s not at home, he’s gone to the staff,” Telyanin’s orderly told him. “Has something happened?” the orderly added, surprised to see the junker’s upset face.::15/1/1885

Monterey Park::251576.18173591178::Pelageya Danilovna, having ordered a space cleared for the guests and snacks served to the masters and servants, not removing her spectacles, with a suppressed smile, walked among the mummers, looking closely at their faces and not recognizing anybody. She not only did not recognize the Rostovs or Dimmler, but she could not recognize her own daughters, or her husband’s robes and uniforms, which they were wearing.::18/3/1872
Marietta::685876.0614349677::He reached out and put his hand on the purse. Rostov let go of it. Telyanin took the purse and began to lower it into the pocket of his riding breeches, his eyebrows raised casually, and his mouth slightly open, as if he was saying: “Yes, yes, I’m putting my purse in my pocket, and it’s quite simple, and it’s nobody’s business.”::8/5/1962
Winchester::93093.2250422002::No laughter was heard in the big maids’ room. In the footmen’s quarters the men all sat silently, ready for something. The caretakers did not sleep and had splinters and candles burning. The old prince paced his study, stepping on his heels, and sent Tikhon to Marya Bogdanovna to ask what news.::11/12/1819
Terre Haute::805866.7228268604::His thin, drawn, yellowish face was all covered with deep wrinkles, which always looked as neatly and thoroughly washed as one’s fingertips after a bath. The movements of these wrinkles constituted the main play of his physiognomy. Now his forehead would wrinkle into wide folds as his eyebrows rose, then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would form on his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always looked out directly and merrily.::20/11/1998
Lebanon::873956.5038307575::“Ah, why do such people as you have children? If you weren’t a father, I’d have nothing to reproach you for,” said Anna Pavlovna, raising her eyes pensively.::4/6/1845

Bohners Lake::144109.20755467215::All Moscow society, from old women to children, received Pierre like a long-awaited guest, whose place was always kept ready and vacant. For Moscow society, Pierre was the most dear, kind, intelligent, merry, and magnanimous of eccentrics, absentminded and warm-hearted, a Russian squire of the old stamp. His purse was always empty, because it was open to everyone.::22/3/1850
Hingham::111380.11755820065::“All right, all right, with me they’ll be safe. With me it’s like state custody. I’ll take them out wherever necessary, and scold them, and pet them,” said Marya Dmitrievna, touching the cheek of Natasha, her goddaughter and favorite, with her big hand.::15/2/1980
Malden::972065.8341928911::“Missed!” cried Dolokhov, and, strengthless, he sprawled face down on the snow. Pierre clutched his head and, turning around, walked off towards the woods, treading on the untouched snow and mouthing incoherent words aloud.::6/9/1856
Lakewood::787914.8198489536::“No, I was only surprised that you’ve left the regiment. Dans un moment je suis &#224; vous, ”*329 he replied to a voice that was calling him.::23/4/1972
Collins::349403.7447186035::It was already the beginning of June when Prince Andrei, on his way home, drove again into that birch woods, where that gnarled old oak had struck him so strangely and memorably. The ringing of the harness bells was still more muffled in the woods than a month ago; everything was filled out, shady, and dense; and the young firs scattered through the woods did not disrupt the overall beauty and, imitating the general character, showed the tender green of their fluffy young shoots.::13/1/1809
Utica::980319.7083179703::Boris, with his comrade Zhilinsky, also came to look at the Preobrazhensky banquet. On his way home, Boris noticed Rostov standing by the corner of a house.::21/4/1849
Cupertino::751149.2032834172::The princess smiled as people smile who think they know more about a matter than those they are talking with.::19/5/1834
Townsend::364476.8816186648::Prince Andrei looked at Tushin and, saying nothing, walked away. Prince Andrei felt sad and downhearted. All this was so strange, so unlike what he had hoped for.::15/10/1838

Gleason::798119.8731010975::Count Ilya Andreich, who, though not a hunter at heart, had a firm knowledge of the rules of hunting, rode to the edge of the bushes where he was to stand, straightened out the reins, settled in the saddle, and, feeling himself ready, looked around, smiling.::10/7/1871
Petaluma::660509.1617511143::In the middle of a sedate conversation about that year’s harvest, begun by Ilagin, Nikolai pointed to his red-spotted bitch.::24/7/1956
Vineland::754011.170633521::The expression of annoyance had already disappeared from Boris’s face; evidently having reflected and decided what to do, he took him by both hands with a particular calm and led him to the neighboring room. Boris’s eyes, looking calmly and firmly at Rostov, were as if veiled by something, as if some sort of screen—the blue spectacles of convention—had been put on them. So it seemed to Rostov.::6/12/1897
Taylorsville::885409.2129567096::It was past three o’clock in the afternoon when Prince Andrei, who had persuaded Kutuzov to grant his request, arrived in Grunt and went to Bagration. Bonaparte’s adjutant had not yet reached Murat’s division, and the battle had not yet begun. In Bagration’s division, nothing was known about the general course of affairs; they talked of peace, but did not believe in its possibility. They talked of battle and also did not believe in the nearness of battle.::8/8/1867
Idaho Falls::620686.4035159247::When they had finished coffee after the liturgy, in the drawing room, where the dustcovers had been removed, it was announced to Marya Dmitrievna that the carriage was ready, and she, with a stern look, dressed in the fancy shawl in which she went visiting, stood up and declared that she was going to see Prince Nikolai Andreevich Bolkonsky, to have a talk with him concerning Natasha.::1/4/1814
Noblesville::817614.6757518719::The colonel was a tall, stout, and sanguine German, obviously a seasoned soldier and a patriot. He took offense at Shinshin’s words.::24/3/1944

New Munster::587950.0676826178::“One thing I don’t understand,” the old man went on. “Who’s going to work the land if they’re freed? Writing laws is easy, but governing is difficult.

Saint Clair Shores::783714.6745418655::Despite all the force of the weary and assured tone in which these words were uttered, Pierre, who had been thinking for so long about his career, was about to object. But Prince Vassily interrupted him in that cooing, bass-voiced tone which precluded the possibility of interrupting his speech and which he made use of in cases requiring extreme persuasiveness.::22/3/1848

Loretta::716579.3066941934::“You say that withdrawal beyond the Niemen is demanded of me in order to begin negotiations; but in just the same way it was demanded of me two months ago that I withdraw beyond the Oder and the Vistula, and, despite that, you agree to conduct negotiations.”::2/12/1895

Chapel Hill::12435.015812802596::Mlle George, with bared, fat, dimpled arms, wearing a red shawl over one shoulder, came out into the empty space left for her among the chairs and stopped in an unnatural pose. Rapturous whispering was heard.::21/12/1990

Bartlett::450491.84064895165::“That’s my Mitka the coachman…I bought him a good balalaika, I like it,” said the uncle. It was the uncle’s custom that, when he came back from the hunt, Mitka would play the balalaika in the bachelor hunters’ room. The uncle liked listening to this music.::13/9/1854
Sanford::156395.6708384354::“J’esp&#232;re, que vous ne direz plus qu’on s’ennui chez moi” §229 —and she glanced at H&#233;l&#232;ne.::15/12/1941

Rio Creek::836619.5253625559::When the reading of Denisov’s venomous papers, which lasted more than an hour, was over, Rostov said nothing and spent the rest of the day in a very sad state of mind, in the company of Denisov’s hospital friends, who again gathered around him. He told them things he knew and listened to what others had to say. Denisov was gloomily silent throughout the evening.::18/2/1916
Symco::403298.1376498391::“Prince, I did not invite you here—go, please, go!” He jumped up and opened the door for him. “Go now,” he repeated, not believing himself and glad of the expression of embarrassment and fear that appeared on Prince Vassily’s face.::21/11/1943
Dubuque::514175.6002040616::As soon as the uhlans had gone down the hill, the hussars were ordered to move up the hill to cover the battery. While the hussars took the place of the uhlans, bullets came flying from the front line, whining and whistling, missing their aim by far.::8/9/1997
Thornton::622157.0596005904::“How do you mean, what the devil is a letter?” said Boris, picking it up and reading the address. “You need this letter very much.”::10/12/1952
Arcadia::266524.22453457216::“Don’t leave!” was all she said to him, in a voice which made him wonder whether he ought indeed to stay, and which he remembered long afterwards. When he was gone, she also did not cry; but for several days she sat, not crying, in her room, not interested in anything and only saying from time to time: “Ah, why did he go?”::2/7/1804
Mindoro::569652.6152146165::“If we start out with good luck, why shouldn’t we make it?” said Balaga. “We used to get you to Tver in seven hours. You surely remember, Your Excellency.”::16/6/1985
Canton::669262.8190682194::“No, life isn’t over at the age of thirty-one,” Prince Andrei suddenly decided definitively, immutably. “It’s not enough that I know all that’s in me, everyone else must know it, too: Pierre, and that girl who wanted to fly into the sky, everyone must know me, so that my life is not only for myself; so that they don’t live like that girl, independently of my life, but so that it is reflected in everyone, and they all live together with me!”::5/1/2012
Johnsburg::967349.2095714192::“Where are you going?” asked an infantry officer, eating an apple, also with a half smile and looking at the beautiful girl.::24/6/2004
Bowie::737678.7373902331::“But what’s worst of all, gentlemen—I’m betraying Kuragin to you—is that the man is in misfortune, and this Don Juan, this terrible fellow, is taking advantage of it!”::5/11/1914

White Plains::843803.6101187043::“What’s happened? What has it got to do with me?” he wondered as he was getting dressed to go to Marya Dmitrievna’s. “If only Prince Andrei would come quickly and marry her!” thought Pierre on his way to see Mrs. Akhrosimov.::12/7/1915
Dale::103872.0680935531::“But he, Ippolit, didn’t he tell you?” said Prince Vassily, turning to his son and seizing the princess by the hand as if she was about to run away and he had barely managed to hold her back, “didn’t he tell you how he himself, Ippolit, pined for the dear princess and how she le mettait &#224; la porte? Oh! C’est la perle des femmes, princesse! ”*247 he said, turning to Princess Marya.::22/9/1857
Des Plaines::389386.18871859997::Each man lives for himself, uses his freedom to achieve his personal goals, and feels with his whole being that right now he can or cannot do such-and-such an action; but as soon as he does it, this action, committed at a certain moment in time, becomes irreversible and makes itself the property of history, in which it has not a free but a predestined significance.::20/5/1846
Doral::853669.0807008389::“And who do you think you  are?” the officer addressed him with drunken rage. “Who do you think you  are? Are you ” (he especially emphasized the word you ) “a superior officer, or what? I’m the superior here, not you.  And you, back!” he repeated, “or I’ll flatten you like a pancake.”::14/2/1950
Buena Vista::584530.039944082::“There’s still time, my friend. Remember, Catiche, it was all done inadvertently, in a moment of wrath, illness, and then forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to correct his mistake, to alleviate his last moments by not allowing him to do this injustice, by not letting him die thinking he has made unhappy those people who…”::22/8/1921
Danbury::269820.33720503753::Supposing that such a reception could be given him only because Davout did not know that he was the emperor Alexander’s adjutant general and even his representative before Napoleon, Balashov hastened to inform him of his rank and purpose. Contrary to his expectation, Davout, having heard Balashov out, became still more stern and rude.::25/4/1826
Margate::917452.2040163426::All his life, at every moment, he possessed the faculty of seeing phenomena in the detached finality of each separate instant, in perfectly distinct outline, as we see only on rare occasions, in childhood, or on the crest of an all-renewing happiness, or in the triumph of a great spiritual victory.::15/9/1979
Kieler::388495.2353390195::“The director of the commission on military regulations is a good friend of mine—Mr. Magnitsky,” he said, articulating each syllable and each word, “and if you wish, I could bring you together with him.” (He paused at the period.) “I hope you will find sympathy in him and a desire to further everything sensible.”::5/6/1899
Santee::922096.1653450284::Having come on Tuesday evening to H&#233;l&#232;ne’s magnificent salon, Boris was not given a clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to come. There were other guests, the countess spoke little to him, and only as he kissed her hand on taking his leave did she, with a strange absence of a smile, unexpectedly, in a whisper, say to him:::14/5/2011
Phlox::916171.7597639124::“Pecause, my tear sir,” he said, pronouncing the b  as a p  and the d  as a t,  “pecause the emperor knows that. He said in the manifesto that he cannot look mit intifference at the tangers that threaten Russia, and that the security of the empire, its tignity, and the sacretness of its alliances …” he said, for some reason giving special emphasis to the word alliances,  as if this was the essence of the matter.::4/2/1848
Fox Crossing::538659.2861219728::He shrugged his shoulders and spread his arms. Pierre was about to say something: the conversation interested him, but Anna Pavlovna, who was keeping watch on him, interrupted.::25/3/1866
Packwaukee::137619.9221779486::“I can’t tell, I don’t know. It’s nobody’s fault,” said Natasha, “it’s my fault. But it’s all terribly painful. Oh, why doesn’t he come!…”::8/9/1844
Kokomo::969832.0475425967::Sonya grieved both at being parted from Nikolai and still more at the hostile tone with which the countess could not help treating her. The count was more preoccupied than ever with the bad state of his affairs, which called for some decisive measures. It was necessary to sell the Moscow house and nearby estate, and to sell the house it was necessary to go to Moscow. But because of the countess’s health, they had to put off the departure from day to day.::8/4/1850
Castle Rock::372192.36181994143::“Delighted, delighted,” he said and, looking her intently in the eye once again, quickly stepped away and sat down in his place. “Sit down, sit down! Mikhail Ivanovich, sit down.”::24/1/1903
Grand Forks::670081.5267610732::“Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Hoo, hoo!” Peals of such healthy and merry guffawing came from among the soldiers that it crossed the line and involuntarily infected the French, after which it seemed they ought quickly to unload their guns, blow up their munitions, and all quickly go back home.::12/4/1862
Midwest City::797203.7143516575::“If you don’t want to do anything, just say so!” Rostov nearly shouted, not looking into Boris’s eyes.::2/6/1925

Saint Peters::995448.4723029555::“We’re going,” Nikolai answered reluctantly, being intent on some serious wolf hunting that day and not wanting to bring Natasha and Petya along. “We’re going, but only for wolves: you’d be bored.”::23/11/1818

Corvallis::534473.4135144686::“Pierre! Been back long?” a familiar voice cried to him. Pierre raised his head. In a double sleigh harnessed to two gray trotters that kicked snow back into the dashboard, Anatole flashed by with his usual friend Makarin. Anatole was sitting upright in the classical pose of a military fop, the lower part of his face wrapped in a beaver collar, his head bent slightly. His face was ruddy and fresh, his white-plumed hat was cocked, revealing his curled and pomaded hair sprinkled with fine snow.::6/3/1966
Hendersonville::433926.97011351713::There was a thaw, mud, cold, the ice on the river broke up, the roads became impassable; for several days provisions had not been issued either to the horses or to the men. Since transport became impossible, men scattered over the abandoned, desolate villages looking for potatoes, but found little even of them.::4/9/1883
New Brunswick::622245.8568910175::Prince Ippolit went over to the little princess and, bringing his face down close to hers, began saying something to her in a half whisper. Two footmen, one the princess’s, the other his, waiting for them to finish talking, stood with shawl and redingote and listened to their French talk, which they could not understand, with such faces as if they understood what was being said but did not want to show it. The princess, as usual, talked smilingly and listened laughingly.::18/9/1882
Taunton::310985.98475253093::The prince’s house was not what was known as “society,” but it was a small circle which, though not much talked about in town, it was very flattering to be received in. Boris had understood that a week ago, when, in his presence, Rastopchin had said to the commander in chief, in response to his invitation to dinner on St. Nicholas’s day, that he could not come:::8/12/1844
Tinley Park::196114.36860487887::“We’re philosophizing,” said Natasha, glancing at him for a moment, and continuing the conversation. The conversation had gone on to dreams.::21/6/1885
Wilmot::980499.0013162979::“A future life?” Prince Andrei repeated, but Pierre gave him no time to reply, and took this repetition for a denial, the more so as he knew Prince Andrei’s former atheistic convictions.::2/1/2000
Diamond Bar::75307.7750301947::At that moment the door, that awful door at which Pierre had stared for so long and which had opened so softly, now opened noisily, banging against the wall, and the younger princess ran out clasping her hands.::12/10/1832
Smyrna::218721.45126376775::Tikhon knew the prince’s habit of sometimes expressing his thoughts aloud, and therefore with an unchanged face met the irately questioning gaze of the face that emerged from the shirt.::20/9/2008
Wanderoos::150284.81682517004::“Pecause, my tear sir,” he said, pronouncing the b  as a p  and the d  as a t,  “pecause the emperor knows that.

Mount Zion::408758.8968659408::Nikolai, his groom, the uncle, and his hunter all rode round and round the beast, hallooing, shouting, preparing to dismount at any moment, when the wolf sat on his haunches, and leaping forward each time the wolf shook himself and made a move towards the timber, which would save him.::20/3/1885
Sarasota::205985.58309857684::As always happens with lonely women who have long lived without the society of men, on Anatole’s appearance all three women in Prince Nikolai Andreevich’s house felt equally that their life had not been life until that moment. The power of thought, feeling, observation instantly increased tenfold in them, as if their life, going on in darkness till then, was suddenly lit up by a new light filled with meaning.::22/5/1890
Greenwood::763016.7584840589::On the evening of the same day, an animated conversation was going on among the squadron officers in Denisov’s quarters.::22/12/1899
Fountain Valley::215264.88642755605::The French, who had stopped firing on this field strewn with dead and wounded because there was nothing left alive on it, seeing an adjutant riding across it, aimed a cannon and fired several shots. The sensation of these whistling, fearsome sounds and the surrounding dead merged for Rostov into a single impression of terror and pity for himself. He recalled his mother’s last letter. “What would she feel,” he wondered, “if she saw me here now, on this field, with cannon aimed at me?”::17/4/1915
Valdosta::111637.73070957395::“What is it?” the countess asked fearfully, but, seeing from her daughter’s face that it was a prank, she sternly waved her hand at her, making a threatening and negative gesture with her head.::11/8/1820
Trego::751675.3533025084::Two witnesses—Khvostikov, a former clerk, whom Dolokhov made use of for gambling, and Makarin, a retired hussar, a kind-hearted and weak man, who had a boundless love for Kuragin—sat in the front room over tea.::5/4/1865
Brill::900785.6893242286::They went into the elegantly, newly, richly decorated dining room. Everything from the napkins to the silverware, china, and crystal bore that special stamp of newness that is found in the households of the recently married. In the middle of supper, the prince leaned his elbow on the table and, with an expression of nervous irritation such as Pierre had never seen in his friend before, began to talk, like a man who has long had something on his heart and suddenly decides to speak it out:::16/7/1939
Oak Lawn::681526.2121032166::The day after her talk with her mother, Natasha waited the whole day for Bolkonsky, but he did not come. On the next day and the third it was the same.

Novato::670544.030343838::“Ah, no, not at all, on the contrary, I’m very glad to make your acquaintance,” said Pierre, and, glancing once again at his new acquaintance’s hands, he took a closer look at his ring. He saw a death’s head on it, a Masonic sign.::4/7/1800
Carlsville::112005.79771461105::“God be with us!” Bagration said in a firm, audible voice, turned for a moment to the front line, and, swinging his arms slightly, with the awkward gait of a cavalryman, as if working at it, he went forward over the uneven field. Prince Andrei felt that some invincible force was drawing him forward, and he experienced great happiness.*223::15/5/1810
Browns Lake::581257.8038399398::He felt that it would take only one word from this man for that whole mass (and he himself bound up with it—an insignificant speck) to go through fire and water, to crime, to death, or to the greatest heroism, and therefore he could not but tremble and thrill at the sight of that approaching word.::10/8/1814
Chicopee::154948.997971876::Rostov fearfully began to justify himself, but seeing the general’s good-naturedly joking face, led him aside and in an agitated voice told him the whole affair, begging the general to intercede for Denisov, whom he knew. The general listened to Rostov, shaking his head gravely.::14/11/1938
Dearborn Heights::414635.77429361::“Ho, ho, ho! Ha, ha, ha, ha! Hoo, hoo!” Peals of such healthy and merry guffawing came from among the soldiers that it crossed the line and involuntarily infected the French, after which it seemed they ought quickly to unload their guns, blow up their munitions, and all quickly go back home.::10/11/1953
Utica::587972.0208471718::“Supper, time for supper! The Gypsies are here!” Indeed, some dark-haired men and women, saying something with a Gypsy accent, were already coming in from the cold. Nikolai knew it was all over, but he said in an indifferent voice:::11/9/1845
Berwyn::700428.1431568931::“About Boris…I know,” she said seriously, “that’s what I came for. Don’t tell me, I know. No, tell me!” She took her hand away. “Tell me, mama. Isn’t he sweet?”::11/9/1847
Bradenton::206741.96252924603::Rostov stood not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen-sighted eyes he recognized the sovereign from afar and followed his approach. When the sovereign had approached to within twenty paces, and Nikolai could make out clearly, in all its details, the handsome, young, and happy face of the emperor, he experienced a feeling of tenderness and rapture such as he had never experienced before. Every feature, every movement of the sovereign seemed lovely to him.::18/7/1874
Poy Sippi::246238.06673900373::“If we get to Vienna, I’ll leave it all there, but there’s nothing to do with it in these trashy little towns,” he said. “Well, young man, give it to me, I’m leaving.”::13/8/1851

Arkdale::270750.42121300875::In the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count Zhilinsky, Boris’s roommate, gave a supper for his French acquaintances.

Hanford::4322.073325764286::The old count rode home. Natasha and Petya stayed with the hunt, promising to come at once. The hunt went further on, because it was still early.

Rocky Mount::261517.28641005888::“Because he’s young, because he’s poor, because he’s a relation…because you don’t love him yourself.”::21/1/1995
Port Arthur::147856.9695778109::The next day the sovereign stayed at Wischau. The court physician Villiers was summoned to him several times. In headquarters and among the nearby troops the news spread that the sovereign was unwell. He had eaten nothing and slept poorly that night, as people close to him said. The cause of it was the strong impression made on the sovereign’s sensitive soul by the sight of the wounded and dead.::16/1/1910
Shoreline::6171.226364081405::As soon as Natasha finished singing, she went over to him and asked him how he liked her voice. She asked it and became embarrassed just after she said it, realizing that it was not a question to be asked. He smiled, looking at her, and said that he liked her singing just as he liked everything she did.::20/5/1964

Deerbrook::894345.820771976::“Those were extremes, to be sure, but the whole meaning wasn’t in them, the meaning was in the rights of man, emancipation from prejudice, the equality of citizens; and Napoleon kept all these ideas in all their force.”::11/7/1945

Commerce City::976213.222337058::It was one of those March nights when it is as if winter wants to claim its own back and with desperate malice pours out its last snows and storms.

Huntersville::786111.9605055288::“But how can you live for yourself alone?” asked Pierre, becoming heated. “What about your son, your sister, your father?”::15/1/1931

Hanover::727644.1876787713::“And how can you judge what would have been better!” he shouted, his face suddenly suffused with blood. “How can you judge the sovereign’s actions, what right have we to discuss it?! We can understand neither the goals nor the actions of the sovereign!”::6/5/1832
Valton::370840.6504492231::But just then Berg came up to Pierre, insistently begging him to take part in an argument between the general and the colonel about Spanish affairs.::25/5/1930
Colton::393205.3582901954::And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed for Prince Andrei all his former interest in the reforms being carried out. That same day Prince Andrei was supposed to dine at Speransky’s “en petit comit&#233;,” *348 as the host had said when inviting him. This dinner in the circle of family and friends of the man whom Prince Andrei so admired had formerly interested him very much, the more so as he had not yet seen Speransky in his domestic surroundings; but now he did not want to go.::1/10/1995
Van Buskirk::759874.180593459::“Le prince Hyppolite Kouragine—charmant jeune homme. Monsieur Kroug, charg&#233; d’affaires de Kopenhague—un esprit profond,”  and simply: “Monsieur Shittoff, un homme de beaucoup de m&#233;rite,” *297 of the one who bore that title.::1/2/1827
Newry::726126.4011175882::“What are you crying for, maman? ” said Vera. “From all that he writes, you should rejoice and not cry.”::22/10/1852
Casa Grande::632137.5664215459::“I don’t take back my word in anything,” he said. “And besides, Sonya is so lovely—what fool would renounce his happiness?”::4/6/1831
West Haven::226071.8723006877::“Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is in Sch&#246;nbrunn, and the count, our dear Count Vrbna, is going to him for orders.”9::15/7/1898
Rosemead::705232.1615356583::“Here, I’m not sorry, take it,” she said, obviously fearful before her master and sorry about the coat.::22/3/1879
Glen Haven::320312.4178613511::Only to the old countess, in bed at night, would Natasha have been able to tell everything she thought. She knew that Sonya, with her strict and wholesome view, would either understand nothing or be horrified by her confession. Natasha, alone with herself, tried to resolve what was tormenting her.::9/1/1978
Blue Springs::110074.86288205005::On the thirteenth of July, the Pavlogradskies were to take part in serious action for the first time.::5/9/1874
Tainter Lake::608682.5327174485::“Adorable, divin, d&#233;licieux!” *383 came from all sides. Natasha looked at the fat George, but heard nothing, saw and understood nothing of what went on before her; she only felt herself again quite irretrievably in that strange, insane world, so far from her former one, that world in which it was impossible to know what was good, what was bad, what was sane and what insane. Behind her sat Anatole, and she, sensing his nearness, waited fearfully for something.::4/2/1888
Hoboken::311158.12115390674::“What nonsense sometimes comes into one’s head!” thought Prince Andrei. “But the one sure thing is that this girl is so sweet, so special, that she won’t spend a month dancing here before she gets married…It’s a rarity here,” he thought, as Natasha, straightening a rose that had gone awry on her corsage, was sitting down beside him.::23/2/1941
Normal::723150.5310077766::“Well, I tell you what, gentlemen,” said Bilibin, “Bolkonsky is a guest in my house and here in Br&#252;nn, and I want to treat him, as far as I can, to all the joys of life here. If we were in Vienna, that would be easy; but here, dans ce vilain trou morave  it’s harder, and I ask you all to help. Il faut lui faire les honneurs de Br&#252;nn. *207 You’ll take the theater upon yourselves, I’ll take society, and you, Ippolit, naturally, the women.”::19/6/1859
Lampson::407892.09893392865::“Here it is!” thought Prince Andrei, seizing the staff of the standard and hearing with delight the whistle of bullets, evidently aimed precisely at him. Several soldiers fell.::19/9/1850
Wabeno::445378.2327944239::“Here’s some Key to the Mystery 44 your H&#233;lo&#239;se sends you. Religious. But I don’t interfere with anyone’s beliefs…I’ve looked through it. Take it. Well, off with you, off with you!”::25/3/1963
Bonita Springs::507828.7764921573::In the course of a boring day, during which Prince Andrei was entertained by the older hosts and the most respected guests, who filled the old count’s house on the occasion of an approaching name-day party, Bolkonsky glanced several times at Natasha, who was laughing at something and having fun among the other, young half of the company, still asking himself: “What is she thinking about? What is she so glad of?”::9/1/1843
Mount Prospect::834234.7491047663::The night he received this information, Kutuzov sent Bagration’s four-thousand-man vanguard to the right over the hills from the Krems–Znaim to the Vienna–Znaim road. Bagration was to make this march without resting, to stop with his face to Vienna and his back to Znaim, and, if he managed to forestall the French, to detain them there as long as he could. Kutuzov himself started out for Znaim with all the heavy baggage.::7/9/1930
Cathedral City::645467.6068534527::Platov’s detachment acted independently of the army. Several times parts of the Pavlogradsky regiment participated in exchanges of fire with the enemy, took prisoners, and once even captured the carriages of Marshal Oudinot. In the month of April, the regiment camped for several weeks near a totally devastated, empty German village, not budging from the spot.::13/7/1905
Briggsville::446855.60587262595::“We’ll see,” replied Rostov. “Karai, phweet!” he cried, answering his uncle’s words with this call. Karai was an ugly and whiskery old he-dog, famous for having gone alone against a seasoned wolf. Everybody took their places.::8/6/1990
Benoit::412688.0023009436::“Halloo!” came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi men, who had stopped. He was standing on a low knoll amidst the stubble with his whip raised, and once more called out: “Hallo-o-o!” (This sound and the raised whip signified that he had spotted a hare in its form in front of him.)::25/4/1992
Rozellville::282120.50698588375::“Papa, you look so handsome, it’s lovely!” said Natasha, standing in the middle of the room and spreading the folds of the gauze.::13/8/1881
Watsonville::763014.9392043055::The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhailovna. Anna Mikhailovna understood that she was being asked to take up this young man, and sitting beside him, she began speaking of his father; but, as with the countess, he gave her nothing but monosyllabic answers. The guests were all taken up with each other.::23/4/1807
Waukau::750631.3973400862::The hounds were united into a single pack, and the uncle and Nikolai rode side by side. Natasha, wrapped in shawls, from which her lively face peeked out with its bright eyes, galloped up to them, accompanied by Petya, who never left her side, and Mikhailo, a hunter and riding master, who was assigned to look after her. Petya laughed at something, and whipped and pulled his horse. Natasha adroitly and confidently sat her black Arabchik and with a sure hand effortlessly reined him in.::25/4/2006
Sobieski::581410.1980622412::She paused. Everyone fell silent, waiting for what would happen and feeling that this was only the preface.::2/8/1836
Connorsville::543547.8935061044::“If you won’t take money from me as a friend, you’ll offend me. I really have got it,” Rostov repeated.::6/11/1926
Pensacola::829675.713130905::“Like this,” said Dolokhov. “And then like this,” he said and raised the collar around her head, leaving it slightly open only in front of her face. “And then like this, see?” and he moved Anatole’s face to the opening in the collar, from which Matryosha’s brilliant smile could be seen.::12/3/1856
Lake Shangrila::906942.7086312699::“Why don’t you begin, Mikhail Larionovich?” the emperor Alexander hurriedly addressed Kutuzov, at the same time glancing courteously at the emperor Franz.::14/9/1906
Lake Wazeecha::92044.72513335715::He asked, “Whose company?” but essentially he was asking, “You’re not scared here, are you?” And the fireworker understood that.::15/6/1819
Palm Beach Gardens::990218.899548386::“Ah, rot! Well, what are you standing there for, scarecrow, off to the sergeant major,” Denisov shouted at Lavrushka.::12/10/1931
Brackett::17473.158179834856::“What can you do? She’s beautiful! I’ll do everything. You can rest easy,” he said brusquely while sealing a letter.::10/7/1917
Lake Havasu City::615389.0514310286::“About life, about man’s purpose. It can’t be. I thought the same, and do you know what saved me? Masonry. No, don’t smile. Masonry is not a religious, not a ritual sect, as I also thought, Masonry is the best, the only expression of the best, the eternal sides of mankind.” And he began to explain Masonry to Prince Andrei as he understood it.::13/7/1887
Sayner::218563.21542248424::Over dinner the conversation turned to the latest political news, about Napoleon’s seizure of the lands of the duke of Oldenburg5 and about a Russian note denouncing Napoleon, which had been sent to all the European courts.::23/1/1936
Dunbar::122230.64378725257::Natasha took up the cause of reconciliation and brought it to a point where Nikolai obtained his mother’s promise that Sonya would not be oppressed, and promised himself that he would not undertake anything in secret from his parents.::3/9/1933
Elyria::561809.612855236::“What fate!” he said. “Masha, dear!” And, throwing off his fur coat and boots, he went to his wife’s rooms.::15/5/2008
Bellevue::677578.7633768372::“Wait,” cried Dolokhov, tapping the bottle against the window to attract attention. “Wait, Kuragin; listen. If anybody else does the same, I’ll pay him a hundred imperials. Understood?”::17/1/1908
Land O' Lakes::303852.45653951744::“Well, what do you want, then? You’re all in love these days. Well, if you’re in love, marry him,” the countess said, laughing crossly. “God help you!”::9/7/1880
Wheaton::965767.9278464136::“It seems there are lots of scribblers around,” said the old prince. “There in Petersburg they’re writing all the time, not only notes but new laws. My Andryusha wrote a whole volume of laws for Russia there. Nowadays everybody writes!” And he laughed unnaturally.::14/12/1977
West New York::379425.653506708::“You mustn’t, you mustn’t!” a frightened voice said from inside. He started pacing the room. The cries ceased, another few seconds went by. Suddenly a terrible cry—not her cry, she could not cry like that—came from the next room. Prince Andrei rushed to the door; the cry ceased, but another cry was heard, a baby’s cry.::5/4/1985
Yucaipa::846828.2680515671::“No, Sonya, I can’t anymore!” said Natasha. “I can’t conceal it from you anymore. You know, we love each other!…Sonya, darling, he writes…Sonya…”::14/12/1991
Southaven::189311.9187228024::“One more question, Count,” he said, “which I ask you to answer not as a future Mason, but as an honest man (galant homme),  in all sincerity: have you renounced your former convictions, do you believe in God?”::4/12/1845
Albany::998726.0789500921::“Ah, it’s that same captain who stood without boots in the canteen,” thought Prince Andrei, glad to have identified the pleasant, philosophizing voice.::1/1/1984
Revere::194339.14790726846::“First of all, Trunila’s not a dog, he’s a bloodhound,” thought Nikolai, and he glanced sternly at his sister, trying to make her feel the distance that should separate them at that moment. Natasha understood it.::24/3/1910
Caldwell::202381.73571442396::“You see, friend,” he said, “we’re asleep until we love. We’re children of dust…but fall in love—and you’re God, you’re pure as on the first day of creation…Who’s that now? Send him to the devil. No time!” he shouted to Lavrushka, who came up to him without the slightest timidity.::18/12/1987
Harrisonburg::911142.5611529195::“Why should you go? I know, you think it’s your duty to gallop off to the army, now that the army is in danger. I understand that, mon cher, c’est de l’h&#233;roisme .”::7/7/1835
West Sacramento::553438.3902113582::“Yes, ma ch&#232;re, ” said the old count, addressing the guest and pointing to his Nikolai. “Here his friend Boris has just been made an officer, and out of friendship he doesn’t want to lag behind; he’s leaving both the university and his old father: he’s going into the army, ma ch&#232;re.  And a post had already been prepared for him in the archives and all.27 Isn’t that friendship?” the count said questioningly.::20/10/1846
Blueberry::131562.62156234134::A tall, beautiful lady entered the neighboring box, with an enormous braid and very bared, white, full shoulders and neck, on which hung a double string of big pearls. She took a long time to settle herself, rustling her heavy silk gown.::20/4/1812
Lenexa::645802.3074770573::It sometimes occurred to Natasha that he did not want to see her, and these surmises were confirmed by the sad tone in which the older people spoke of him.::1/10/1985
Maplewood::573834.439040955::“Your health!” said Balaga, also drinking his glass and wiping his mouth with his handkerchief. Makarin, tears in his eyes, embraced Anatole.::4/6/1892
Irma::783561.7023305956::They approached a flooded river, which they had to cross by ferry. While the carriage and horses were being loaded, they boarded the ferry.::23/3/1978
Kingsport::339600.1074750582::That whole day and the next, Rostov’s friends and comrades noticed that he was not dull, not angry, but silent, pensive, and concentrated. He drank reluctantly, tried to stay alone, and kept thinking about something.::14/3/1878
Burlington::767703.5346662134::In the middle of a sedate conversation about that year’s harvest, begun by Ilagin, Nikolai pointed to his red-spotted bitch.::5/9/1878
Delano::521779.6685329626::“Stop joking. I wanted to talk seriously with you. You know, I’m displeased with your younger son. Just between us,” her face acquired a sad look, “there was talk about him at her majesty’s, and you were pitied…”::14/8/2007
Leesburg::627453.0685476604::“Ah, Sonya, if you knew him as I do! He said…He asked me what sort of promise I had made to Bolkonsky. He was glad that it rested with me to refuse him.”::17/5/1937
Brooks::221883.22269163962::As happens in early youth, and especially when one is alone, he felt a gratuitous tenderness for this young man and promised himself to be sure to become friends with him.::19/8/1972
DeSoto::600342.3103841316::“I? I? What have I got to do with it? Leave me out of it. It’s not I who am getting married. What about you,  miss? That’s what it’s desirable to know.”::24/2/1887
City of Milford (balance)::52955.39355084167::“Te-n-n-n-HUT!” shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shattering voice, overjoyed for himself, strict in regard to the regiment, and welcoming in regard to his approaching superior.::19/1/1989
Emerald::910964.0895279528::The regimental doctor came and said it was necessary to bleed him. A deep dish of dark blood came from Denisov’s shaggy arm, and only then was he able to tell what had happened to him.::19/2/1976
Little Rapids::673077.1583115993::“Educate this bear for me,” he said. “He’s been living with me for a month, and this is the first time I’ve seen him in society. Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the company of intelligent women.”::6/1/1976
Perth Amboy::993471.9162501772::The next day Prince Andrei went to the Rostovs’ for dinner, as Count Ilya Andreich had invited him, and spent the whole day with them.::23/8/1873
Alderley::830772.2667963849::“What do you mean?” asked the countess, as if she did not know what the guest was talking about, though she had already heard the cause of Count Bezukhov’s distress a good fifteen times.::15/7/1815
Peabody::288937.00661167176::Lazarev sat in the place of honor; he was embraced, congratulated, his hands were shaken by Russian and French officers. Crowds of officers and people came merely to look at Lazarev. A droning of Russian and French talk and laughter hung over the tables on the square. Two officers with flushed faces, merry and happy, walked past him.::22/8/1967
Haven::410219.55793363164::Sometimes, looking at the strange but funny steps the dancers made, having decided once and for all that, as they were dressed up, no one could recognize them, and therefore not feeling embarrassed—Pelageya Danilovna covered her face with her handkerchief, and her whole corpulent body shook with unrestrainable, kindly, old-woman’s laughter.::9/8/1990
Brookhaven::555211.1431586567::“You do know her husband?” said Anna Pavlovna, closing her eyes and pointing to H&#233;l&#232;ne with a sad gesture. “Ah, she’s such an unhappy and lovely woman! Don’t speak of him in her presence, please don’t speak of him. It’s too painful for her!”::7/5/1910
Minnetonka::41633.084338271845::The countess, with a coldness such as her son had never seen, replied to him that he was of age, that Prince Andrei was going to marry without his father’s consent, and that he could do the same, but that she would never recognize this intriguer  as her daughter.::24/3/1971
Stone Lake::847500.38093071::“What about it, Fedeshou!…Did he say when the fighting would begin? You were standing closer. They all said Boonapart himself was stationed in Brunovo.”::4/5/2013
Palm Desert::24274.780700011655::“Not Kutuzov, but what’s his name—well, it makes no difference, there weren’t many left alive. Go over there, to that village, all the superiors are assembled there,” said this officer, pointing to the village of Hostieradek, and he passed by.::19/3/1803
Placentia::408491.3027666841::“Dieu sait quand reviendra…”  the prince sang off-key, laughed still more off-key, and left the table.::13/6/1999
Elkhart::122213.41436172296::“At least to put a fright into those little nuns. There are some Italian girls, young ones, they say. Really, I’d give five years of my life!”::25/3/1917
Joplin::710712.0578468506::“Tomorrow,” thought Rostov, “I may very well be sent on some sort of mission to the sovereign. Thank God!”::11/7/1830
Rome::774152.5529248789::“My friend, what have you done in Moscow? Why did you quarrel with Lelya, mon cher?  You are mistaken,” said Prince Vassily as he came in. “I’ve found out everything and can tell you for certain that H&#233;l&#232;ne is as innocent before you as Christ before the Jews.”::4/4/1996
Gordon::244647.0449340653::The steward did not say it was completely impossible; to achieve that goal, he suggested selling the woodlands in Kostroma province, selling the bottomlands and the Crimean estate. But all these operations, as the steward spoke of them, became bound up with such a complexity of processes of lifting prohibitions, requesting permissions, and so on, that Pierre was at a loss and only said to him: “Yes, yes, do that.”::22/8/1833
Pinellas Park::350974.11316349515::“Prince Vassily. He was very nice. He agreed at once to do everything and reported to the emperor,” Princess Anna Mikhailovna said with rapture, forgetting entirely about all the humiliation she had gone through to achieve her goal.::16/5/1942
Gagen::646921.4593762371::From behind the door came the regular sounds of a lathe. The princess timidly pulled the easily and smoothly opening door and stopped in the doorway. The prince was working at the lathe and, having glanced at her, went on with what he was doing.::14/1/1864
La Crosse::103752.77862162601::Denisov bent over her hand, and she heard strange, incomprehensible sounds. She kissed him on his black, tousled, curly head. At that moment there was a hasty rustle of the countess’s skirts. She went up to them.::16/9/1833
Cavour::532864.3833162456::“I’m relying on you, my dear friend,” Anna Pavlovna said, also softly, “you’ll write to her and tell me comment le p&#232;re envisagera la chose. Au revoir .”†67 And she left the front hall.::6/12/1829
Grapevine::496947.7093201572::“Yes,” said Natasha. “You see, Nikolenka, don’t be angry, but I know you won’t marry her. I know, God knows how, but I know for certain that you won’t marry her.”::2/10/1901
Doering::762386.1785016423::“Eh, mon cher vicomte,”  Anna Pavlovna mixed in, “l’Urope”  (for some reason she pronounced it l’Urope,  as if it was some special subtlety of the French language, which she could allow herself when speaking with a Frenchman), “l’Urope ne sera jamais notre alli&#233;e sinc&#232;re.” §301::5/5/1828
Apple Valley::724156.0320098586::“Well, generally, talk as much as possible. Audiences are his passion; but he neither likes nor is able to talk himself, as you’ll see.”::2/4/1889
Tigard::771374.9690950206::“If there was treason and there were proofs of his secret communications with Napoleon, they would be made public,” he said heatedly and hastily. “Personally I don’t like and have never liked Speransky, but I do like justice.” Pierre now recognized in his friend the all too familiar need to worry and argue about things extraneous to him, only in order to stifle his all too painful innermost thoughts.::24/6/1878
Glendora::731425.2632233648::“Ah, my God! My God!” he said. “And to think of who—of what nonentities—can be the cause of people’s unhappiness!” he said with a malice that frightened Princess Marya.::7/4/1999
Florissant::425558.710690695::Ilya Andreich approved of this suggestion, grasping its good sense at once. If the old man softens, it will be all the better if they come to him in Moscow or Bald Hills afterwards; if not, then they could marry against his will only in Otradnoe.::2/5/1855
Oak Park::891995.4881948078::When Princess Marya came back from her father, the little princess was sitting over her work, and she looked at Princess Marya with that special expression of an inward and happily serene gaze that only pregnant women have. It was clear that she did not see Princess Marya, but was looking deep inside herself—into something happy and mysterious that was being accomplished in her.::9/2/2007
Hoffman Estates::582068.2296230221::Though Prince Vassily listened to the elderly lady reluctantly and almost impolitely, and even showed impatience, she smiled at him gently and touchingly, and even took him by the arm to keep him from walking away.::16/3/1811
Hager City::647260.4496091965::“Nikolenka, you’re talking nonsense—keep quiet, keep quiet! Keep quiet, I tell you!” she almost shouted, in order to drown out his voice.::16/9/1949
Bancroft::104805.2796205613::This was that initial period of a campaign when the troops still find themselves in good order, almost on the level of a peacetime review of maneuvers, only with a tinge of warlike showiness in their dress, and with a moral tinge of that gaiety and enthusiasm that always accompany the beginning of a campaign.::13/4/1916
Kentwood::731446.3006494084::“Yes,” said Nikolai. I remember that I came to you later and wanted to comfort you, and, you know, I was ashamed. We were terribly funny. I had a little toy figure then, and I wanted to give it to you. Remember?”::18/10/1836
Holcombe::788690.9954136487::“I presume that Freemasonry is the fraternit&#233;  and equality of men with virtuous goals,” said Pierre, embarrassed, even as he was speaking, by the unsuitability of his words to the solemnity of the moment. “I presume…”::6/6/1826
Waumandee::492276.0972650466::“C’est trahison peut-&#234;tre,” *212 said Prince Andrei, vividly imagining gray greatcoats, wounds, gunsmoke, the sounds of shooting, and the glory that awaited him…::2/5/1884
Battle Creek::89844.26611732377::“Well, but in truth, Marie, I wonder if father’s character isn’t sometimes hard on you?” Prince Andrei asked suddenly.::21/4/2007
Grand Island::659886.5309273461::He exchanged a few words with Prince Andrei and Chernyshov about the present war, with the expression of a man who knows beforehand that it will all go badly and who is not even displeased by that. The unbrushed tufts of hair on his nape and his hastily slicked down side-whiskers were the most eloquent confirmation of it.::6/3/2004
Wiota::849041.5766565067::The soldier at whom the laughing men were pointing was Dolokhov. Prince Andrei recognized him and listened to what he was saying. Dolokhov and his company commander had come to the line from the left flank, where their regiment was stationed.::23/7/1899
Aliso Viejo::711775.0531397812::As rumor had it, the purpose of sending Savary was to propose peace and to propose a meeting between the emperor Alexander and Napoleon. A personal meeting, to the joy and pride of the whole army, was refused, and instead of the sovereign, Prince Dolgorukov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate with Napoleon, on the chance that these negotiations, contrary to expectation, had as their purpose a real desire for peace.::8/10/1818
Germania::903044.5198725399::The countess was so tired out from the visits that she ordered no one else to be received, and the porter was told simply to be sure to invite for dinner everyone who came by with congratulations. The countess wanted to talk personally with her childhood friend, Princess Anna Mikhailovna, whom she had not seen properly since her return from Petersburg. Anna Mikhailovna, with her weepy and pleasant face, moved closer to the countess’s armchair.::20/10/2007
Elton::937306.4318042301::“My God! How happy I’d be if he ordered me right now to throw myself into the fire,” thought Rostov.::20/9/1816
Edina::213027.56428163915::He made as if to rise. The generals bowed and withdrew. It was already past midnight. Prince Andrei left.::12/2/1999
Lake Tomahawk::551107.0670247118::“Hasn’t been back since evening. Must’ve lost,” replied Lavrushka. “I know for sure, if he wins, he comes early so as to boast, but if he stays away till morning, it means he blew it—and he’ll come angry. Shall I serve coffee?”::4/3/1849
Olympia::739342.8226542238::“She needs rest,” said Prince Andrei, wincing. “Isn’t it so, Liza? Take her to your rooms, and I’ll go to father. How is he, the same?”::1/1/1916
Long Lake::492981.8672971054::Such passion, the passion of creative contemplation, Tolstoy constantly carried within him. It was precisely in its light that he saw everything in its pristine freshness, in a new way, as if for the first time. The authenticity of what he saw differs so much from what we are used to that it may appear strange to us. But Tolstoy was not seeking that strangeness, was not pursuing it as a goal, still less did he apply it to his works as a literary method.::20/12/1985
Willard::646974.1857679604::Sonya was sitting at the clavichord and playing the prelude to the barcarolle  that Denisov especially liked. Natasha was preparing to sing. Denisov was looking at her with rapturous eyes.::19/1/2001
Tripoli::167152.64006724494::“Why did you never come to Annette’s?” the little princess asked Anatole. “Ah! I know, I know,” she said, winking, “your brother Ippolit has told me about your affairs. Oh!” she shook her finger at him. “I even know your Parisian pranks!”::24/7/1809
Yellow Lake::278920.9245695332::After this outburst, the prince never once spoke of the matter again. But his suppressed vexation with his son’s faint-heartedness showed itself in the relations between father and daughter. To the previous subjects of mockery a new one was added—talk about stepmothers and his amiability towards Mlle Bourienne.::25/2/1993
Parker::972183.665243639::“My beauty, my queen!” the nanny said, coming through the door. “And Sonyushka, too, what beauties!…”::4/11/1830
Enid::897138.7296469865::“When it’s time for my wife to give birth, send to Moscow for an accoucheur *176 …So that he’ll be here.”::19/6/1905
Superior Village::637069.2551707497::“Yes, but entre nous, ”*85 said the countess, “it’s a pretext. He’s come, essentially, to see Count Kirill Vladimirovich, having learned that he was so poorly.”::17/3/1898
Peru::423778.67476633814::“General in Chief Kutuzov?” the just-arrived general spoke quickly, with a strong German accent, glancing to both sides and going to the door of the office without pausing.::10/10/1824
Burien::24929.714500528942::“Ah! The warrior! So you want to defeat Bonaparte?” said the old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the braided queue, which was in Tikhon’s hands, would let him. “At least give him a good drubbing, or pretty soon he’ll be writing us down, too, as his subjects. Greetings!” And he offered his cheek.::11/8/1891
Caroline::66864.65616178716::The lieutenant was sitting in the second room of the tavern over a plate of sausage and a bottle of wine.::15/4/1824
Coral Gables::724202.8512349589::Having talked for some time in the general circle, Speransky got up and, going over to Prince Andrei, called him away to the other end of the room. It was clear that he considered it necessary to concern himself with Bolkonsky.::6/3/1868
Logan::469805.64211639395::On the Pratzen hill, in the same place where he fell with the staff of the standard in his hands, Prince Andrei Bolkonsky lay bleeding profusely and, unbeknownst to himself, letting out soft, pitiful, and childlike moans.::3/6/1831
Evergreen::555709.9684702877::“One is always too clever with the older children, wanting to do something extraordinary,” said the guest.::21/2/1862
Plainfield::221109.1562547176::“Who’s that bowing there? Junker Mironov! Not right, look at me!” shouted Denisov, who could not stay still and fidgeted on his horse in front of the squadron.::22/9/1811
Cerritos::843933.200028772::“Well, now, they say, my dear, that you were educated abroad. Not like your father and me, who were taught to read by the beadle. Tell me, my dear, you’re now serving in the horse guards?” the old man asked, studying Anatole closely and intently.::7/10/1807
Galveston::237062.8920556308::The next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter; but she noticed that over dinner he ordered the food served starting with Mlle Bourienne. At the end of dinner, when the butler, out of old habit, again served the coffee starting with the princess, the prince suddenly flew into a rage, flung his cane at Filipp, and at once gave orders for him to be sent as a soldier.::14/10/1944
Coeur d'Alene::338167.9968652041::H&#233;l&#232;ne joyfully welcomed Natasha and loudly admired her beauty and her attire. Soon after their arrival, Mlle George left the room to get dressed. In the drawing room they began arranging chairs and sitting down. Anatole moved a chair for Natasha and was about to sit next to her, but the count, who never took his eyes off Natasha, sat next to her. Anatole sat behind them.::18/4/1881
Lakewood::495407.91453744995::After all that Napoleon had said to him, after those outbursts of wrath, and after those last drily spoken words—“Je ne vous retiens plus, g&#233;n&#233;ral, vous recevrez ma lettre” —Balashov was convinced that Napoleon not only would not wish to see him, but would try not to see him—the envoy he had insulted and, moreover, the witness to his unseemly vehemence. But, to his surprise, Balashov received that day, through Duroc, an invitation to the emperor’s table.::13/2/1956
Poway::889848.4398178894::That was perfectly correct, but the count, and the countess, and Natasha—everyone looked at her with reproach. “Who does she take after?” thought the countess.::25/5/1960
Methuen::613580.0028933669::During a figure in which he had to choose a lady, whispering to H&#233;l&#232;ne that he wanted to choose Countess Potocki, who seemed to have gone out to the balcony, he rushed, gliding over the parquet, to the door to the garden and, seeing the sovereign stepping onto the terrace with Balashov, stopped. The sovereign and Balashov were heading for the door. Boris, flustered, as if he had no time to retreat, pressed himself deferentially to the door frame and lowered his head.::20/2/1909
Troy::129160.05556963306::“What is it? What’s wrong?” asked both princesses, seeing Prince Andrei and the momentarily emerging figure of the old man in a white smock, wigless, and in an old man’s spectacles, shouting in an angry voice.::4/8/1945
New Franken::824374.679826487::“I expected help from you, and there’s nothing, nothing—you, too!” said her eyes. She was not surprised that he had come; she did not understand that he had come. His coming had no relation to her suffering and its relief. The pain started again, and Marya Bogdanovna advised Prince Andrei to leave the room.::7/7/1873
Upson::120849.49976340953::On returning from leave, joyfully welcomed by his comrades, Nikolai had been sent for a remount and had brought excellent horses from Little Russia, which pleased him and earned him the praises of his superiors. During his absence, he had been promoted to captain, and when the regiment was put on wartime status with an increased complement, he was again given his old squadron.::23/8/1927
Azusa::720588.5039735398::“What do I care if M’sieur Pierre is here,” the little princess said suddenly, and her pretty face suddenly spread into a tearful grimace. “I’ve long wanted to say to you, Andr&#233;: why have you changed so much towards me? What have I done to you? You’re going into the army, you have no pity for me. Why is it?”::21/3/1985
Joel::815772.5300300551::“He wasn’t always an old man. But I tell you what, Natasha, I’ll have a talk with Borya. He oughtn’t to come so often…”::7/10/1846
Lake Ripley::495476.3992993291::Nesvitsky was there as an old member of the club. Pierre, who, on his wife’s orders, had let his hair grow long and removed his spectacles, was fashionably dressed, but walked about the rooms with a sad and dejected air. As everywhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of people who bowed before his wealth, and he treated them with a habitual lordliness and absentminded disdain.::5/2/1950
Juda::279105.5058989188::“Forgive me,” said Prince Andrei, “but you’re so young, and I’ve already experienced so much of this life. I fear for you. You don’t know yourself.”::13/4/1891
Wilson::966651.6945645107::“Where the devil did you stuff those foot cloths?” said an orderly, running behind the cart and rummaging in the back.::17/11/1959
Bedford::934409.3983101179::“Yes, true for you,” the countess went on. “Up to now, thank God, I’ve been a friend to my children and have enjoyed their full trust,” said the countess, repeating the error of many parents who suppose that their children have no secrets from them. “I know that I’ll always be my daughters’ first confidente  and that if Nikolenka, with his fiery character, gets up to some mischief (boys can’t do without it), it still won’t be the same as with these Petersburg gentlemen.”::25/7/1806
Woodford::108579.53720733027::Rostov went on ahead to carry out his errand, and, to his great surprise, discovered that Dolokhov, this rowdy duellist, lived in Moscow with his old mother and hunchbacked sister, and was a most affectionate son and brother.::17/6/1860
Hollister::945473.311590818::Returning late in the evening, Sonya came into Natasha’s room and, to her surprise, found her still dressed, asleep on the sofa. On the table next to her lay the opened letter from Anatole. Sonya picked up the letter and started reading it.::24/2/1818
Stillwater::521280.68257340335::The countess, trying to conceal this action from herself and the doctor, would put a gold piece in his hand and go back to her daughter each time with her heart more at ease.::13/2/1844
Downers Grove::516882.17500973423::“You’re dear to me especially because you’re the only live person in our whole society. That’s fine for you. Choose whatever you like; it’s all the same. You’ll be fine anywhere, but there’s one thing: stop going to those Kuragins and leading that sort of life. It simply doesn’t suit you: all this carousing with hussars, and all…”::16/3/1835
Lac du Flambeau::618383.0244165488::“Or that I should get upset that another man’s dog catches it and not mine—all I want is to admire the chase, isn’t that so, Count? Then, in my opinion…”::25/11/1808
Apopka::854082.0112578009::But at that same moment everything became covered with smoke, there was the sound of gunfire nearby, and a na&#239;vely frightened voice two steps from Prince Andrei cried: “Well, brothers, that’s it for us!” And it was as if this voice was a command. At this voice everyone began to run.::25/1/1978
Summerville::108250.18309538903::“I have come to you with a suggestion and a message, Count,” he said, without sitting down. “A person very highly placed in our brotherhood has solicited for you to be received into the brotherhood before the fixed term, and has suggested that I be your sponsor. I consider it my sacred duty to fulfill the will of this person. Do you wish, under my sponsorship, to enter the brotherhood of Freemasons?”::21/1/1838
Monroe::911852.0725286949::“You see, Prince, we can’t rid ourselves of these folk,” said the staff officer, pointing to them. “The commanders neglect discipline. And here,” he pointed to a sutler’s tent, “they crowd in and sit. This morning I drove them all out: look, it’s full again. We must ride over, Prince, and scare them away. For a moment.”::7/8/2012
Murray::409084.7275688341::Prince Ippolit fetched her reticule, came after her, and, moving his chair towards her, sat down close by.::6/3/1916
La Mirada::970307.1007211665::“Column, form up for the attack!” The infantry ahead of them doubled up their platoons to let the cavalry pass by. The uhlans set off, pennants flying on their lances, and trotted downhill towards the French cavalry, which had appeared at the foot of the hill to the left.::16/11/1830
Cuyahoga Falls::775901.6430732051::The French, who had stopped firing on this field strewn with dead and wounded because there was nothing left alive on it, seeing an adjutant riding across it, aimed a cannon and fired several shots. The sensation of these whistling, fearsome sounds and the surrounding dead merged for Rostov into a single impression of terror and pity for himself. He recalled his mother’s last letter. “What would she feel,” he wondered, “if she saw me here now, on this field, with cannon aimed at me?”::11/12/1828
Collierville::154350.246287845::To the left below, in the fog, exchanges of fire between unseen troops could be heard. There, it seemed to Prince Andrei, the battle would concentrate, there an obstacle would be encountered, and “it’s there that I’ll be sent with a brigade or division, and there, with a standard in my hand, I’ll go forward and crush everything ahead of me.”::23/4/1876
Dayton::190010.37368833818::The moment he went in, he saw that the nanny was hiding something from him with a frightened look, and that Princess Marya was no longer by the crib.::2/9/2016
Batavia::768140.301998746::The next morning Marya Dmitrievna took the girls to the Iverskaya Chapel and to Mme Aubert-Chalmet, who was so afraid of Marya Dmitrievna that she always let her have dresses for less, so as to get rid of her quickly. Marya Dmitrievna ordered almost the whole trousseau. On coming home, she drove everyone but Natasha out of the room and called her favorite to her armchair.::14/10/1953
Charleston::478750.2162288896::“What then? Eh?” Anatole repeated, genuinely puzzled by the thought of the future. “What then? I don’t know what then…But why talk nonsense!” He looked at his watch. “It’s time!”::9/3/1814
Newark::14337.769449549342::“So you’re not afraid to gamble with me?” Dolokhov repeated, and, as if in order to tell a merry story, he set the cards down, leaned back in his chair, and, with a smile, slowly began to speak:::13/12/1873
Saginaw::446802.5397198425::During the initial time of his stay in Petersburg, Prince Andrei felt that his whole way of thinking, developed in his solitary life, was completely overshadowed by the petty cares that consumed him in Petersburg.::8/5/1871
Rancho Santa Margarita::307080.8233605079::Anatole left the room and came back in a few moments wearing a fur coat with a silver belt and a sable hat, dashingly cocked to one side, which was very becoming to his handsome face. After looking in the mirror, he stood in front of Dolokhov in the same posture he had assumed in front of the mirror and took a glass of wine.::18/11/1820
Cypress::94831.92511394301::“Quite different and yet the same,” thought Nikolai, looking at her face all lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his hands under the coat that covered her head, embraced her, pressed her to him, and kissed her on the lips, which had a mustache on them and smelled of burnt cork. Sonya kissed him right in the middle of the lips and, freeing her small hands, put them to his cheeks.::3/3/1983
Harrisburg::728627.765578754::But the countess did not want to put the question that way: she did not want a sacrifice from her son, she would have liked to sacrifice herself for him.::3/6/1802
Dunwoody::451954.8460294145::“It’s cleverly written, there’s no saying it’s not,” said Tushin. “But that’s not the point, Vassily Dmitrich,” he also turned to Rostov, “a man ought to submit, but Vassily Dmitrich here doesn’t want to. The auditor told you your case was going badly.”::12/2/1915
Allenville::816291.0072157583::Petya, her brother, was also upstairs: he and his tutor were preparing fireworks to be set off at night.::5/5/1961
East Lansing::825533.008463233::“Gentlemen! Who wants to make a bet with me? I’ll do the same thing,” he suddenly shouted. “And there’s no need for a bet, that’s what. Tell them to bring a bottle. I’ll do it…tell them.”::12/8/1891
Keshena::941634.3487084438::Prince Andrei spoke his mind so clearly and distinctly that it was evident he had thought about it more than once, and he spoke eagerly and quickly, like a man who has not spoken for a long time. His gaze became the more animated, the more hopeless his opinions were.::7/9/1872
Middletown::700627.303636897::On Sunday morning, Marya Dmitrievna invited her guests to the liturgy at her parish of the Dormition on Mogiltsy.12::14/8/1801
Herbster::977283.4981555362::“The island of Madagascar,” she said. “Ma-da-gas-car,” she repeated each syllable distinctly and, not answering Mme Schoss’s question about what she was saying, left the room.::24/8/1955
Saint Louis Park::643967.3254073499::“Loathsome woman!” the princess cried, suddenly falling upon Anna Mikhailovna and tearing the portfolio from her.::7/6/1835
Minot::456138.4043646263::“Catch, Rugai!” he said, tossing him the cutoff paw with dirt stuck to it. “You earned it—right you are!”::14/4/1861
Bethesda::792199.3353257768::Zherkov, not taking his hand from his cap, briskly started his horse and galloped off. But as soon as he left Bagration, his strength failed him. An insurmountable fear came over him, and he was unable to go where there was danger.::22/11/1978
Sheboygan::876346.9928355601::Pierre took off his spectacles, and his eyes, on top of the general strangeness of people’s eyes when they take off their spectacles, had a frightened and questioning look. He was about to bend down to her hand and kiss it; but she, with a quick and crude movement of her head, intercepted his lips and brought them together with her own. Her face struck Pierre by its altered, unpleasantly perplexed expression.::12/1/1830
Mishawaka::503089.4597080048::“Did you hear about the latest event at the review in Petersburg? What a show the new French ambassador made of himself!”::23/7/1969
Niagara Falls::998781.7290694487::“You know what?” said Pierre, as if a lucky thought had unexpectedly occurred to him. “Seriously, I’ve been thinking that for a long time. With this life I can’t decide or even consider anything. I have a headache and no money. He invited me tonight, but I won’t go.”::9/8/1923
Ogema::210017.2005496228::“And do you remember how we were rolling eggs in the reception room and suddenly there were two old women, and they started twirling on the carpet. Did that happen or not? Remember how good it was…”::17/6/1805
Smyrna::524476.226846913::“Since last evening my fate is sealed: to be loved by you or to die. I have no other way out,” the letter began. Then he wrote that he knew the family would not give her to him, that there were secret reasons for that which he could reveal only to her, but that if she loved him, she had only to say the word “yes” and no human powers would prevent their bliss. Love would overcome all. He would abduct her and carry her off to the ends of the earth.::3/9/1892
Covina::167652.42603738117::“Et vous disiez, que les dames russes ne valaient pas les dames fran&#231;aises. Il faut savoir s’y prendre.” ‡70::23/5/2001
Portage::189327.1902120557::“Je vous demande pardon, une tabati&#232;re avec le portrait de l’Empereur est une r&#233;compense, mais point une distinction,”  said the diplomat, “un cadeau plut&#244;t.” *307::13/9/1882
Cedar Hill::42478.67629558677::“Don’t touch me,” said Rostov, drawing back. “If you need the money, take it.” He flung the purse at him and ran out of the tavern.::24/8/1810
Ceres::323254.9269158792::“I’ve come on my own, my provider,” Ivanushka said, trying to speak in a bass voice. “I met Pelageyushka only in Yukhnovo.”::18/10/1993
Texas City::117907.27949379543::It was also the second week that the horses had been eating straw from the roofs of houses; they were hideously skinny and still covered with their winter coat, which was matted in clumps.::21/12/1822
Twin Falls::90037.91894510982::At the beginning of March, the old count Ilya Andreevich Rostov was taken up with arranging a dinner at the English Club in honor of Prince Bagration.::8/4/2005
Medina::906686.4128903832::“Toujours charmante et m&#233;lancolique, cette ch&#232;re Julie,” ‡371 she said to the daughter. “Boris says his soul is eased in your house. He has suffered so many disappointments, and he is so sensitive,” she said to the mother.::18/6/1811
Gilmanton::344186.8657790064::When Ilagin took leave of Nikolai in the evening, Nikolai was so far from home that he accepted his uncle’s offer to quit the hunt and spend the night with him (the uncle) in his village of Mikhailovka.::3/8/1881
Roswell::796057.9350268418::“Good-bye, dear heart,” she said to the countess, who came to see her to the door; “wish me success,” she added in a whisper, so that her son would not hear.::10/6/1868
Huntington::159044.14224770913::“I beg your pardon! I beg your pardon! As God is my witness, I didn’t know,” the old man muttered, and, having looked Natasha up and down, he left. Mlle Bourienne was the first to recover after this apparition and began talking about the prince’s ill health. Natasha and Princess Marya silently looked at each other, and the longer they looked at each other silently, without saying what they needed to say, the more ill-willed were their thoughts about each other.::2/10/1867
Madison::433820.0955572568::“It’s the Bonapartists who say that,” said the viscount, not looking at Pierre. “Right now it’s hard to know public opinion in France.”::13/12/1892
Boardman::397973.60391193547::But it was she, in a new dress, unfamiliar to him, which must have been made in his absence. Everyone let him go, and he ran to her. When they came together, she fell on his breast, weeping. She could not lift her face, and only pressed it to the cold cords of his Hungarian jacket. Denisov, unnoticed by anyone, came into the room, stood there, and rubbed his eyes looking at them.::8/2/1824
Wauwatosa::447910.20288683835::He glanced at Balashov with pity, and just as Balashov was about to observe something, he again hastily interrupted him.::17/6/1886
Laona::582150.9412787248::“They barely managed to save the poor fellow,” the guest went on. “That’s how intelligently the son of Count Kirill Vladimirovich Bezukhov amuses himself!” she added. “And I heard he was so well-bred and intelligent. There’s what all this foreign upbringing leads to. I hope no one receives him here, despite his wealth. They wanted to introduce him to me. I decidedly refused: I have daughters.”::9/1/1921
Lawrence::360770.7842669983::“I’m coming from the staff, Count. Have you heard about Raevsky’s feat?” And the officer recounted the details of the battle of Saltanovo, which he had heard at the staff.::6/2/1810
Kannapolis::852397.1233025393::“We’ve said our good-byes…off with you!” he said suddenly. “Off with you!” he shouted in a loud and angry voice, opening the door of the study.::7/4/1910
Millston::334227.5035523893::The expression of annoyance had already disappeared from Boris’s face; evidently having reflected and decided what to do, he took him by both hands with a particular calm and led him to the neighboring room. Boris’s eyes, looking calmly and firmly at Rostov, were as if veiled by something, as if some sort of screen—the blue spectacles of convention—had been put on them. So it seemed to Rostov.::18/9/1834
Burnett::940587.9463547986::“So you won’t go on? And I had a nice card ready.” As if he was most interested in the amusement of the game itself.::15/9/1978
Little Round Lake::151820.43317075056::Noticing on Balashov’s face the unpleasant impression produced by this reception, Davout raised his head and coldly asked what he wanted.::22/2/1937
Carter::65040.211376380605::“For God’s sake, Sonya, don’t tell anyone, don’t torment me,” Natasha pleaded. “Remember, it’s wrong to interfere in such things. I revealed it to you…”::24/6/2013
Northport::378864.45943060744::“Ah, I know that. I know, I know,” Natasha picked up. “I was still little when it happened to me. Remember, I was punished once for the plums, and you were all dancing, but I sat in the schoolroom and cried. I cried so much, I’ll never forget it. I felt sad, and sorry for everybody, myself and everybody else. And the main thing was that I wasn’t guilty,” said Natasha, “remember?”::15/7/1971
Alexandria::374688.7200171829::In the front hall, Denisov, crouching on the threshold with his pipe, sat facing the sergeant major, who was reporting something. Seeing Rostov, Denisov winced and pointed over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where Telyanin was sitting, winced again, and shuddered with loathing.::4/11/1864
Saint Cloud::697625.7373683905::“But can one get through in a sleigh?” he asked the steward, who accompanied him back to the house, a respectable man, in face and manner resembling his master.::7/12/1848
Wylie::302336.58582713496::Bolkonsky made use of this time to go to Dolgorukov and find out the details of the action. Prince Andrei sensed that Kutuzov was upset and displeased about something, and that there was displeasure with him at headquarters, and that all the persons of the imperial headquarters used with him the tone of people who knew something that others did not, and therefore he wanted to talk with Dolgorukov.::19/11/1934
Palm Springs::995153.0147557197::“I believe you also wanted to go, maman ? Do you need a carriage?” he said, turning to his mother with a smile.::6/3/1981
Lacey::91195.58220412095::“Not yet, ” Napoleon put in, and, as if afraid of giving way to his emotion, he frowned and inclined his head slightly, thereby letting Balashov feel that he could go on.::18/4/1920
Chesterfield::655059.804729144::“Seventh,”  said the rhetor, “try by frequent thoughts of death to bring yourself to the point where it no longer seems a fearsome enemy to you, but a friend…who delivers the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from this calamitous life and leads it to the place of recompense and peace.”::12/10/2013
Roseville::936977.6874882864::That was the count’s favorite dance, which he used to dance while still in his youth. (“Daniel Cooper” was in fact one of the figures of the anglaise .)::5/10/1888
Vaudreuil::68324.16704340327::Pierre, with a meek smile of pity and regret, his legs and arms spread helplessly, his broad chest exposed, stood before Dolokhov and looked at him sorrowfully. Denisov, Rostov, and Nesvitsky closed their eyes. The shot and Dolokhov’s angry cry came simultaneously.::24/2/1869
West Bloomfield::952531.9642273317::“I think the battle will be lost, and I said so to Count Tolstoy and asked him to convey it to the sovereign. And what do you think he replied? Eh, mon cher g&#233;n&#233;ral, je me m&#234;le de riz et des c&#244;telettes, m&#234;lez-vous des affaires de la guerre. †264 Yes…That was the answer I got!”::9/11/1804
Helenville::391022.5729381241::“So-o-onya! One word! How can you torment me and yourself so because of a fantasy?” said Nikolai, taking her hand.::20/5/1943
Sandy Hook::770969.5610989319::At that same time, Andrei was sitting with Pierre and telling him of his love for Natasha and of his firm intention to marry her.::3/12/1922
San Luis Obispo::13812.089478500211::They rode to the opposite hill. From this hill they could already see the French. Prince Andrei stopped and began to examine.::21/1/2011
Glenview::193021.88621912565::“Awaiting orders, Your Excellency, to be dispatched to my new assignment,” replied Boris, showing neither vexation at the prince’s abrupt tone, nor the wish to get into conversation, but so calmly and deferentially that the prince looked at him intently.::24/4/1935
Neopit::189988.4864091349::“Hard to find…” repeated the count, obviously sorry that Semyon had stopped talking so soon. “Hard to find,” he said, pulling back the skirt of his jacket and taking out his snuffbox.::7/7/1855
Hines::867123.6839875358::Having come home and told their mother how they spent the time at the Melyukovs’, the girls went to their room. They undressed, but without wiping off their cork mustaches, and sat for a long time talking about their happiness. They talked about how they would live when they were married, how their husbands would be friends, and how they would be happy. Mirrors prepared by Dunyasha since evening stood on Natasha’s table.::23/9/2005
San Jacinto::818666.9817673122::In the front hall the outside door opened, someone asked, “Are they at home?” and someone’s footsteps were heard. Natasha was looking in the mirror, but did not see herself. She was listening to the sounds in the front hall. When she did see herself, her face was pale. It was he.  She knew it for certain, though she had barely heard the sound of his voice through the closed door.::15/11/2011
Euclid::689775.9833846238::Prince Andrei entered a tidy, unostentatious office and saw by the desk a forty-year-old man with a long waist, a long, close-cropped head, and thick wrinkles, with scowling brows over dull, hazel-green eyes and a drooping red nose. Arakcheev turned his head towards him without looking at him.::18/1/2006
Martinsville::589894.6083654419::Having come on Tuesday evening to H&#233;l&#232;ne’s magnificent salon, Boris was not given a clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to come. There were other guests, the countess spoke little to him, and only as he kissed her hand on taking his leave did she, with a strange absence of a smile, unexpectedly, in a whisper, say to him:::1/3/1909
Apex::120128.98819865214::“Don’t joke about that, Denisov,” cried Rostov, “this is such a lofty, such a beautiful feeling, such a…”::20/11/1996
East Providence::847001.5299448888::“And do you want to kiss me?” she whispered barely audibly, looking at him from under her eyebrows, smiling and almost weeping with excitement.::1/2/1944
Salina::964413.7691258391::“No, that abb&#233; is very interesting, only he has the wrong notion of things…In my opinion, eternal peace is possible, but I don’t know how to say it…Only it’s not through political balance…”::19/5/1920
Draper::940958.4189461906::Telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostov had left him, rubbing his small white hands.::6/4/1973
Goodman::517488.6652754858::Mikhail Ivanovich, who had no idea when this you and I had spoken such words about Bonaparte, but who understood that he was needed in order to launch into the favorite subject, looked at the young prince in surprise, not knowing what would come of it.::3/3/2015
Harshaw::499422.0526538363::“Trifles!” the colonel boomed. “Two hussars wounded and one killed on the spot, ” he said with obvious joy, unable to hold back a happy smile, sonorously rapping out the beautiful phrase killed on the spot.::21/4/1832
Jeffersonville::949641.423240016::“And can you do it?” Natasha asked. The uncle smiled without answering. “Go, Anisyushka, see whether my guitar has all its strings or not. Haven’t set hand to it for a long time, right you are! Gave it up.”::19/1/1915
Bentonville::21036.62410918483::“Gentlemen, I’ll do anything, nobody will hear a word from me,” Rostov said in a pleading voice, “but apologize I cannot, by God, I cannot, do what you will! How am I going to apologize, like a little boy asking forgiveness?”::25/10/1850
Lincoln::423786.36630917434::“Ah, vous exp&#233;diez le courrier, princesse, moi j’ai d&#233;j&#224; expedi&#233; le mien. J’ai &#233;cris &#224; ma pauvre m&#232;re,” *151 the smiling Mlle Bourienne spoke in a quick, pleasant, juicy little voice, swallowing her r ’s and bringing with her into the concentrated, sad, and dreary atmosphere of Princess Marya a completely different, frivolously gay and self-contented world.::12/11/2007
Hattiesburg::408763.55181610823::“No, dear heart,” spoke a pleasant voice, which seemed familiar to Prince Andrei, “I say that if it were possible to know what there will be after death, none of us would be afraid of death. That’s so, dear heart.”::24/1/1954
Charlottesville::818372.149067211::Tushin did not tell him that there were no covering troops, though that was the plain truth. He was afraid to let down  another officer that way and silently, with fixed eyes, looked straight into Bagration’s face, as a confused student looks into his examiner’s eyes.::12/1/1997
Edgewood::129858.21911809858::The princess, with her dry and straight waist, incongruously long for her legs, looked straight and passionlessly at the prince with her prominent gray eyes. She shook her head and, sighing, turned to look at the icons. Her gesture could have been interpreted either as an expression of sorrow and devotion, or as an expression of weariness and hope for a speedy repose. Prince Vassily interpreted this gesture as an expression of weariness.::6/10/1983
Maricopa::617019.311974178::“I don’t think so,” he said, “although—yes. She doesn’t deign to be intelligent…Ah, no, she’s enchanting, that’s all.”::12/3/1904
Marengo::330665.3892410256::“Look, look,” one soldier said to his comrade, pointing to a Russian musketeer who had gone up to the line along with an officer and was speaking rapidly and heatedly with a French grenadier. “See how clever he patters away. Even the Khrenchman can’t keep up with him. Now you, Sidorov…”::17/9/1894
Columbus::127897.31688457406::And, having dismissed Mavrusha, Natasha went through the reception room to the front hall. An old servant and two young ones were playing cards. They broke off their game and stood up when the young lady came in. “What shall I do with them?” thought Natasha.::3/5/1901
Mentor::136095.39977460715::While Prince Andrei went to report about the purple general, that general, who obviously did not share Boris’s notions about the advantages of the unwritten subordination, so fixed his eyes on the insolent ensign who had prevented him from finishing his talk with the adjutant that Boris felt awkward. He turned away and waited impatiently for Prince Andrei to come back from the commander in chief’s office.::4/2/1909
Potter Lake::136857.7939257336::When Prince Andrei went into the study, the old prince, in his old man’s spectacles and his white smock, in which he received no one except his son, was sitting at the table and writing. He looked up.::23/10/1807
Winnebago::88698.56310194057::Prince Andrei arrived at the quarters of General Bennigsen, who occupied a small manor house right on the bank of the river. Neither Bennigsen nor the sovereign was there; but Chernyshov, the imperial adjutant, received Bolkonsky and announced to him that the sovereign had ridden with General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci to make a second round of the fortifications of the Drissa camp, the suitability of which had become a subject of strong doubts.::19/4/1838
Mansfield::878371.5555484355::Kutuzov turned away without answering him, and his gaze chanced to rest on Prince Andrei, who was standing close by. Seeing Bolkonsky, Kutuzov softened the angry and caustic expression of his gaze, as if aware that his adjutant was not to blame for what was going on. And, without answering the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolkonsky:::13/12/1920
Keller::737647.0315484073::“We haven’t seen each other for long time,” he said. “Thank you for coming. Let me just finish the game, and Ilyushka will come with the chorus.”::20/10/1880
Middletown::230768.5278259366::Before Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile appreciatively at these words of the viscount’s, Pierre again burst into the conversation, and Anna Pavlovna, though she anticipated that he would say something improper, could no longer stop him.::2/2/1961
Elmhurst::754960.8049859497::“No, why do you think,” Pierre suddenly began, lowering his head and looking like a butting bull, “why do you think that way? You shouldn’t think that way.”::8/8/1930
Beavercreek::203942.35686037055::He shaved, scented himself with a thoroughness and foppishness that had become habitual to him, and with his innately good-humored and triumphant expression, carrying his handsome head high, went into his father’s room. Two valets were bustling around Prince Vassily, dressing him; he himself looked around animatedly and nodded cheerfully to his entering son, as if to say: “Right, that’s how I need you to look!”::5/6/1958
Bloom City::873152.3207389646::“Yes, to ask for her hand again, to be magnanimous and all that?…Yes, it’s very noble, but I can’t walk sur les bris&#233;es de monsieur. *389 If you wish to be my friend, never speak to me of that…of all that. Well, good-bye. You will deliver it?…”::16/1/1909
Stitzer::238258.10534090252::“You mean you don’t understand? Nikolenka would understand…Bezukhov—he’s blue, dark blue with red, and he’s rectangular.”::25/9/1940
Everett::895281.7061864905::“Mon cher,”  said Kochubey, “even in this matter you cannot avoid Mikhail Mikhailovich. C’est le grand faiseur. *337 I’ll tell him. He promised to come this evening…”::20/7/2017
Little Sturgeon::440194.69732304115::As her animation increased, the prince looked at her more and more sternly, and suddenly, as if he had studied her enough and arrived at a clear idea of her, turned away and addressed Mikhail Ivanovich.::11/6/1904
Clearwater Lake::754391.1665036398::“No, I must treat you to Kuragin,” Bilibin said softly to Bolkonsky. “He’s charming when he argues about politics, you should see such gravity.”::10/9/1962
Littleton::172029.01446983675::“Very glad to see you. Go in where they’ve assembled, and wait for me.” The sovereign went to the study. He was followed by Prince Pyotr Mikhailovich Volkonsky and Baron Stein, and the doors closed behind them. Prince Andrei, taking advantage of the sovereign’s permission, went, along with Paulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, into the drawing room where the council was assembled.::7/7/1893
Titusville::302072.07409652113::The next day, having taken leave of the count alone, without waiting for the ladies to come out, Prince Andrei drove home.::6/10/1803
Dellwood::325399.3967104014::“Like this,” said Dolokhov. “And then like this,” he said and raised the collar around her head, leaving it slightly open only in front of her face. “And then like this, see?” and he moved Anatole’s face to the opening in the collar, from which Matryosha’s brilliant smile could be seen.::2/7/1902
Biloxi::917014.0311171837::In 1852, he joined the army as a noncommissioned officer and served in Wallachia. Two years later he was promoted to ensign and was transferred at his own request to the Crimea, where he fought in the Crimean War and was present at the siege of Sevastopol. His Sevastopol Sketches,  which were published in 1855, made him famous in Petersburg social and literary circles. They were a second and fuller attempt at a true depiction of war.::4/10/1928
Ellison Bay::253000.98827859308::He looked intently and questioningly into his friend’s eyes, evidently searching in vain for the answer to some question.::19/7/1873
West Lafayette::218979.6957207576::“I agree with you completely,” replied Nikolai, blushing all over, turning his plate and rearranging the glasses, and with such a determined and desperate air as though he was exposed right then to great danger. “I’m convinced that the Russians must either die or conquer,” he said, aware himself, as the others were, once the word had been spoken, that it was too rapturous and pompous for the present occasion and therefore awkward.::3/6/1803
Newark::769137.5265195292::“I won’t allow anyone to call me a liar!” cried Rostov. “He called me a liar, and I called him a liar. Let it remain at that. He can assign me to duty every day, or put me under arrest, but no one will make me apologize, because if he, as the regimental commander, considers it beneath him to give me satisfaction, then…”::4/4/2015
Binghamton::16504.958597765795::“No, promise me you won’t refuse. It won’t be any trouble for you, and there won’t be anything in it that’s unworthy of you. Only you’ll comfort me. Promise, Andryusha,” she said, putting her hand into her reticule and taking hold of something in it, but not showing it yet, as if what she was holding constituted the object of her request, and before she got his promise to fulfill her request, she could not take this something  out of her reticule.::10/10/1943
Dublin::308813.3416330798::“How shall I tell you,” Natasha replied. “I was in love with Boris, with my teacher, with Denisov, but this is not the same at all. I feel peaceful, firm. I know that there’s no one better than he, and I feel so calm, so good now. Not at all like before…”::22/8/2008
Eagleton::280924.9406369221::After four days of solitude, boredom, consciousness of his dependence and insignificance, felt especially sharply after the milieu of power in which he had been so recently, after several marches with the marshal’s baggage and the French troops, who occupied the entire area, Balashov was brought to Vilno, now occupied by the French, through the same gate from which he had ridden out four days earlier.::15/4/1970
Beaumont::242915.8860281371::Outside there was the same immobile cold, the same moon, only it was still brighter. The light was so strong and there were so many stars on the snow, that one did not want to look at the sky, and the real stars went unnoticed. The sky was black and dull, the earth was merry.::23/1/1933
Fort Pierce::976967.9554017::“I have the pleasure of speaking with Count Bezukhov, if I’m not mistaken,” the traveler said unhurriedly and loudly. Pierre looked silently and questioningly at his interlocutor through his spectacles.::19/7/1972
Leland::1033.005414186605::In other conversations she praised Julie and advised Nikolai to go to Moscow for the holidays to amuse himself. Nikolai guessed what his mother’s conversations were driving at, and during one of these conversations he got her to speak quite openly. She told him that all her hope for straightening out their affairs now lay in his marrying Miss Karagin.::5/11/1925
Bozeman::445324.07574404706::Bagration rode around the ranks that had gone past him and dismounted. He handed the reins to a Cossack, removed and handed over his felt cloak, stretched his legs, and straightened his peaked cap. The head of the French column, with officers in the fore, appeared from the bottom of the hill.::16/11/1949
Blacksburg::485164.83538135525::“Well, Nastasya Ivanovna,” the count said in a whisper, winking at him, “if you frighten the beast away, Danilo will give it to you.”::13/4/1863
Burleson::202930.44451449506::Natasha, pale, stern, was sitting next to Marya Dmitrievna, and her feverishly glittering, questioning gaze met Pierre just at the door. She did not smile, did not nod to him, she only looked at him fixedly, and her gaze asked him only this: was he a friend, or, like everybody else, an enemy in relation to Anatole? Pierre himself evidently did not exist for her.::22/11/1864
Riplinger::810406.8484789652::Davout looked at him silently, and the slight trouble and confusion expressed on Balashov’s face clearly afforded him pleasure.::6/1/1982
Coachella::171906.6778565511::This letter had not yet been given to the sovereign when Barclay told Bolkonsky at dinner that the sovereign would like to see Prince Andrei in person, in order to question him about Turkey, and that Prince Andrei was to go to Bennigsen’s quarters at six o’clock in the evening.::14/3/1805
Lewis::575322.5233744815::Even though Iogel did not acknowledge this mazurka as authentic, everyone admired Denisov’s skill, began choosing him constantly, and the old men, smiling, began to talk about Poland and the good old days. Denisov, flushed from the mazurka and wiping himself with a handkerchief, sat down by Natasha and did not leave her for the whole ball.::18/10/2007
Sayreville::602395.9923972881::Mlle George gave the public a stern and gloomy look and began to recite some verses in French in which the talk was of her criminal love for her son.13 In places she raised her voice, in places she whispered, solemnly lifting up her head, in places she paused and gasped, rolling her eyes.::1/6/1968
Ocoee::129814.12860568831::“No apologies, decidedly nothing,” Dolokhov replied to Denisov, who for his part also made an attempt at reconciliation, and he also walked to the designated place.::22/3/1961
Hackensack::803891.0360232252::And she kissed her on the head. Sonya got up, the kitten revived, its eyes sparkled, and it seemed ready to raise its tail any moment, spring up on its soft paws, and play with a ball of yarn, as a kitten ought to do.::23/12/1813
Cutler Bay::427289.988052214::Before Rostov had time to think and determine how far away those shots were, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy’s adjutant came galloping from Vitebsk with orders to proceed down the road at a trot.::6/4/1816
Iron Belt::794678.8583072888::Sitting in his former schoolroom, on the sofa with padded armrests, and looking into Natasha’s desperately lively eyes, Rostov again entered that world of his family and childhood, which had no meaning for anyone but him, but which had provided him with one of the best enjoyments in life; and the burning of the arm with a ruler to show love did not seem nonsense to him; he understood and was not surprised at it.::18/10/1894
Cleveland Heights::482091.55340394715::“What do I think? I’ve been listening to you. That is all so,” said Prince Andrei. “But you say, ‘Join our brotherhood, and we’ll show you the goal of life and the purpose of man and the laws that govern the world.’ But who are we? —just people. How do you know everything? How is it that I alone do not see what you see? You see the kingdom of the good and the true on earth, and I don’t see it.”::12/8/1995
Danville::691115.258552821::“Well, good-bye, Your Excellency, be well,” said Rastopchin, getting up with his peculiarly quick movements and holding out his hand to the prince.::8/12/1842
Strongsville::81406.272157443::After his talk with his wife, Pierre went to Petersburg. At the Torzhok posting station there were no horses, or else the postmaster did not want to give them to him. Pierre had to wait. Without undressing, he lay down on a leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big feet in their warm boots on the table, and lapsed into thought.::1/5/1996
Altoona::515526.03460440174::Prince Andrei kept glancing with a smile now at Pierre, now at the viscount, now at the hostess. For the first moment of Pierre’s outburst, Anna Pavlovna was horrified, accustomed though she was to society; but when she saw that despite the blasphemous speeches uttered by Pierre, the viscount did not lose his temper, and when she became certain that it was now impossible to suppress these speeches, she gathered her forces and, joining the viscount, attacked the orator.::12/6/1875
Bothell::710910.9678762687::Having drawn even with the infantry guards, he noticed that cannonballs were flying over and around them, not so much because he heard the sound of the cannon, but because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers’ faces, and on the officers’ an unnatural military solemnity.::12/9/1851
Attleboro::288191.35176360735::“Well, that’s it, that’s it,” the general said angrily, taking the glass from his eye and shrugging his shoulders, “that’s it, they’re going to fire on the crossing. And what are they dawdling for?”::13/1/1896
Haltom City::535988.7785595485::“Yes, perhaps…” Dolokhov answered coldly and angrily, glancing at Sonya, and, frowning, he glanced at Nikolai exactly as he had looked at Pierre during the club dinner.::13/9/1812
Oakland Park::602019.4436304912::“I wonder if it’s not too late to give extreme unction?” the lady asked, adding his clerical title, as if she had no opinion on the subject.::14/7/1928
Cleveland::773837.1385840612::“Rubbish!” he shouted so that the veins swelled like ropes on his neck and forehead. “You’ve lost your mind, I tell you, I won’t stand for it. The purse is here; I’ll skin this scoundrel alive, and it will be here.”::12/3/2004
El Centro::3562.719468219733::“Missed!” cried Dolokhov, and, strengthless, he sprawled face down on the snow. Pierre clutched his head and, turning around, walked off towards the woods, treading on the untouched snow and mouthing incoherent words aloud.::1/4/1982
Morgan Hill::817176.8538691441::“Je vous demande pardon, une tabati&#232;re avec le portrait de l’Empereur est une r&#233;compense, mais point une distinction,”  said the diplomat, “un cadeau plut&#244;t.” *307::4/4/1869
Bountiful::234002.82452521726::Prince Andrei, in saying this, was less than ever like that Bolkonsky who sat sprawled in Anna Pavlovna’s armchair and, narrowing his eyes, uttered French phrases through his teeth. His dry face was all aquiver with the nervous animation of every muscle; his eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now shone with a bright, radiant brilliance. One could see that, the more lifeless he seemed in ordinary times, the more energetic he was in moments of irritation.::1/3/1958
North Miami Beach::155957.09718313845::“Sonya!” she said suddenly, as if guessing the real reason for her cousin’s distress. “Vera must have talked with you after dinner? Did she?”::3/1/2008
Tichigan::250019.56263139535::The folds on his forehead, gathered till then, quickly released themselves as a sign of satisfaction, and, smiling slightly, he began to examine his nails.::10/10/1980
York::574730.0856036419::The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhailovna. Anna Mikhailovna understood that she was being asked to take up this young man, and sitting beside him, she began speaking of his father; but, as with the countess, he gave her nothing but monosyllabic answers. The guests were all taken up with each other.::23/1/1994
Pine Bluff::166192.73132268587::“Congratulations to the dear name-day lady and her children,” she said in her loud, dense voice, which overwhelmed all other noises. “And you, you old sinner,” she turned to the count, who was kissing her hand, “I bet you’re bored in Moscow? No chasing about with dogs here? Nothing to be done, old boy, look how these birdies are growing up.” She pointed to the girls. “Like it or not, you’ll have to hunt for suitors.”::12/7/1878
Middle Village::425774.36484002793::His thin, drawn, yellowish face was all covered with deep wrinkles, which always looked as neatly and thoroughly washed as one’s fingertips after a bath. The movements of these wrinkles constituted the main play of his physiognomy. Now his forehead would wrinkle into wide folds as his eyebrows rose, then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would form on his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always looked out directly and merrily.::21/8/1956
Lombard::599848.2666865543::The prince stopped. He noticed the impression these words made on his daughter. She hung her head and was about to cry.::5/8/1851
Drummond::908837.3745438704::As rumor had it, the purpose of sending Savary was to propose peace and to propose a meeting between the emperor Alexander and Napoleon. A personal meeting, to the joy and pride of the whole army, was refused, and instead of the sovereign, Prince Dolgorukov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate with Napoleon, on the chance that these negotiations, contrary to expectation, had as their purpose a real desire for peace.::13/12/1863
Oro Valley::517596.85462683527::“What’s that?” he said crossly, and his hand carelessly twitched, pouring an extra number of drops from the vial into the glass. He dumped the medicine on the floor and asked for more water. The maid gave it to him.::7/10/1973
Lompoc::155303.4676364946::And he sat down in his place again, paying no further attention to the daughter he had driven to tears.::1/4/1990
Genesee Depot::43866.46412763617::“Adieu, Andr&#233;! Rappelez-vous que les malheurs viennent de Dieu, et que les hommes ne sont jamais coupables” *416 were the last words he heard from his sister as he was taking leave of her.::14/2/1898
North Lauderdale::915520.6929082891::The brisk song gave a special meaning to the tone of casual merriment with which Zherkov spoke, and to the intentional coldness of Dolokhov’s replies.::11/2/1902
Rockwall::285490.808892792::“Yes, nice, nice children,” agreed the count, who always resolved all tangled questions by finding everything nice. “Just look at him! Decided to be a hussar! Well, what do you want, ma ch&#232;re !”::22/7/1996
Altamonte Springs::650995.4163654159::The brisk song gave a special meaning to the tone of casual merriment with which Zherkov spoke, and to the intentional coldness of Dolokhov’s replies.::11/12/1964
Marana::275835.4414645096::He embraced his daughter, then Pierre again, and kissed him with his old man’s mouth. Tears actually wet his cheeks.::21/11/1808
Lake Wisconsin::157462.74108935677::“Don’t raise dust, you footsloggers!” joked a hussar, whose horse, prancing, splashed mud at the infantryman.::3/11/1934
Freeport::439122.3638072801::What Prince Vassily referred to as “received from Ryazan” was several thousand in quitrent, which Prince Vassily kept for himself.::12/12/1981
Sierra Vista::8886.215536632935::Pierre’s face, pale before then, became distorted with rage. He seized Anatole by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and began shaking him from side to side, until Anatole’s face acquired a sufficiently frightened expression.::3/4/1914
Rib Mountain::680745.7396372098::“You sleep, I can’t,” the first voice answered, coming close to the window. She evidently leaned all the way out of the window, because he could hear the rustle of her dress and even her breathing. Everything became hushed and stone-still, like the moon and its light and shadows. Prince Andrei was also afraid to stir, lest he betray his involuntary presence.::7/12/1909
Forest Junction::249958.79689203514::Anna Pavlovna had already managed to speak with Liza about the match she was contriving between Anatole and the little princess’s sister-in-law.::14/4/1886
DeKalb::265629.77948120935::Prince Andrei spoke his mind so clearly and distinctly that it was evident he had thought about it more than once, and he spoke eagerly and quickly, like a man who has not spoken for a long time. His gaze became the more animated, the more hopeless his opinions were.::19/10/1819
Liberty Pole::177282.35176579276::“Since last evening my fate is sealed: to be loved by you or to die. I have no other way out,” the letter began. Then he wrote that he knew the family would not give her to him, that there were secret reasons for that which he could reveal only to her, but that if she loved him, she had only to say the word “yes” and no human powers would prevent their bliss. Love would overcome all. He would abduct her and carry her off to the ends of the earth.::9/7/1982
Prescott Valley::874766.0706853749::Anatole agreed and went to Moscow, where he stayed with Pierre. At first, Pierre received Anatole reluctantly, but then he got used to him, occasionally went carousing with him, and gave him money in the guise of loans.::12/2/1885
Salem::27657.1565712479::Pierre’s gloomy, unhappy face struck her. She stopped in front of him. She wanted to help him, to transfer to him the overflow of her own happiness.::3/6/1971
Urbandale::169319.3085598861::The little princess had filled out during this time, but her eyes and her short lip with its little mustache and smile rose as gaily and sweetly as ever when she began to speak.::12/2/1878
Benderville::229250.00268373164::“A letter from Nikolenka? Surely!” cried Natasha, reading the affirmative answer in Anna Mikhailovna’s face.::8/12/1832
Waubeka::779106.780363052::Pierre, his shoulders hunched and his mouth gaping, listened to what Marya Dmitrievna was telling him and could not believe his ears. Prince Andrei’s fianc&#233;e, so deeply loved, this once sweet Natasha Rostov, to exchange Bolkonsky for that fool Anatole, who was already married (Pierre knew the secret of his marriage), and fall in love with him so much as to agree to elope with him!—that Pierre could not understand and could not imagine.::16/4/1857
Navarino::972170.3234557833::“You are mistaken,” Boris said unhurriedly, with a bold and slightly mocking smile. “I am Boris, the son of Princess Anna Mikhailovna Drubetskoy. The Rostov father is called Ilya, the son is Nikolai. And I never knew any Madame Jacquot.”::1/1/1854
Clam Lake::184201.14401798503::The stately figure of Nesvitsky, accompanied by the Cossack, and the resoluteness of Denisov, waving his saber and shouting desperately, had such an effect that they pushed through to the other end of the bridge and stopped the infantry. At the exit Nesvitsky found the colonel to whom he was to give the order, and, having fulfilled his mission, rode back again.::5/4/2018
Jefferson City::118942.62117069043::“It’s the Bonapartists who say that,” said the viscount, not looking at Pierre. “Right now it’s hard to know public opinion in France.”::5/4/2008
San Bruno::411959.535540361::“I’ll skip two letters and read the third,” the prince said sternly. “I’m afraid you write a lot of nonsense. I’ll read the third.”::3/4/1990
Fond du Lac::602043.4989483379::“The squadron can’t pass,” shouted Vaska Denisov, angrily baring his white teeth, spurring his handsome raven-black Bedouin, who, twitching his ears from running into bayonets, snorting, spraying foam around him from his bit, jingling, stamped his hooves on the planks of the bridge and seemed ready to jump over the railing if his rider would let him.::22/9/1925
Plainfield::304072.78473973955::The regiment broke up into companies and dispersed to their assigned quarters not far from Braunau, where they hoped to find footgear, mend their clothes, and get some rest after their hard marching.::8/2/1803
Sextonville::567787.322764832::“As soon as we have a certain number of worthy people in every state, each of them will in turn form two more, and they will all be closely united with each other—then everything will be possible for the order, which has already secretly succeeded in doing much for the good of mankind.”::20/8/1906
Pilsen::772265.6850818499::“Papa, you look so handsome, it’s lovely!” said Natasha, standing in the middle of the room and spreading the folds of the gauze.::12/3/1991
Oneida::130686.44900926552::And the regimental commander, reflected as in a mirror, invisibly to himself, in the hussar officer, bounced, came forward, and replied:::12/3/1818
Legend Lake::459225.40123506886::“I don’t like to keep company with the Bezukhov woman and I don’t advise it; but if you’ve already promised, go, divert yourself,” she added, addressing Natasha.::11/6/1904
Concord::429931.2071542172::“Back!” Semyon shouted at a dog that had stepped out of the bushes. The count gave a start and dropped the snuffbox. Nastasya Ivanovna dismounted and went to pick it up.::10/3/1923
Pittsfield::875196.5821269585::It was becoming frightening. It was obvious that the affair, having begun so lightly, could no longer be prevented by anything, that it was going on by itself, independently of men’s will, and would be accomplished. Denisov first went to the barrier and announced:::16/10/1923
Riverton::891412.7718317779::“I hope to see you again, but I also hope that you will change your opinions, my dear M’sieur Pierre,” she said.::14/4/1983

Namekagon::997342.8808059475::“Dere hass been no occasion,” a German doctor said to an adjutant, “dat one remains alife after a second shtroke.”::10/9/1814
Leander::317790.6564802411::Again there appeared on all the cheerful faces of the men of the squadron that serious trait that had been there when they were under fire. Rostov, never taking his eyes away, kept looking at his enemy, the regimental commander, wishing to find on his face a confirmation of his surmises; but the colonel never once glanced at Rostov, but, as always at the front, looked stern and solemn. The command was heard.::5/11/2016
Astico::893523.3748415777::Rostov fearfully began to justify himself, but seeing the general’s good-naturedly joking face, led him aside and in an agitated voice told him the whole affair, begging the general to intercede for Denisov, whom he knew. The general listened to Rostov, shaking his head gravely.::12/8/1822

Je vous aime mieux dans votre petite robe grise de tout les jours. Non, de gr&#226;ce, faites cela pour moi. *241 Katya,” she said to the maid, “bring the princess her little gray dress, and watch, Mlle Bourienne, how I’m going to arrange it,” she said, with a smiling foretaste of artistic delight.::2/1/1902

Prescott::796878.6068657056::“That’s better, Count!” the staff captain repeated, as if beginning to call him by his title on account of his acknowledgment. “Go and apologize, Your Excellency, yes, sir.”::24/7/1853
Daleyville::59416.771612064265::“I won’t sleep anyway. How stupid it is to sleep! Mama, mama, nothing like this has ever happened to me!” she repeated with astonishment and fear before the feeling she was aware of within her. “Who could have thought!…”::10/7/1953
Dalton::876942.7566532231::“My friend,” said Princess Marya, addressing her brother from beside the crib where she was standing, “it’s better to wait…later…”::4/9/2015
Little Elm::715512.0800614691::“Well, as you will,” said the staff captain. “So, what’s become of the blackguard now?” he asked Denisov.::17/10/1982
Moorhead::434049.4457341676::“I don’t even know what’s in this document,” said the princess, turning to Prince Vassily and pointing to the inlaid portfolio she was holding in her hands. “I only know that the real will is in his desk, and this is a forgotten document…” She tried to go around Anna Mikhailovna, but Anna Mikhailovna sprang over and again barred her way.::1/5/1801
Brea::116901.81417603996::“Right you are!…I just knew,” the uncle began (he was a distant relation, a none-too-wealthy neighbor of the Rostovs), “I just knew you wouldn’t stay home, and it’s a good thing you didn’t. Right you are!” (This was the uncle’s favorite saying.) “Take the reserve at once, because my Girchik told me the Ilagins are at Korniki with their hunt. They’ll snatch the litter—right you are!—straight out from under your nose.”::24/2/1860
Linden::911063.8722896466::“Yes, maybe I do love a poor girl,” Nikolai said to himself, “and what, should I sacrifice my feeling and honor for money? I’m surprised that mama could say it to me. Because Sonya’s poor,” he thought, “does it mean I can’t love her, can’t respond to her faithful, devoted love? And I’d surely be happier with her than with some doll of a Julie. I can’t command my feelings,” he said to himself. “If I love Sonya, my feeling is stronger and higher than everything for me.”::6/10/1893
Springbrook::10310.705672067488::“Hallooloo,” Rostov said in a whisper, protruding his lips. The dogs, jingling the metal rings of their collars, jumped up, cocking their ears. Karai finished scratching his haunch and stood up, cocking his ears and slightly wagging his tail, from which tufts of fur hung.::13/2/1948
Rancho Palos Verdes::163211.68067810778::Our army, after repeated retreats, advances, and battles around Pultusk and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting the arrival of the sovereign and the start of a new campaign.::17/8/1845
The Colony::512520.4989519404::“That’s doubtful,” said Prince Andrei. “Monsieur le vicomte  quite rightly supposes that things have already gone too far. I think it would be hard to return to the old ways.”::16/4/2018
Fontana::872945.7347800559::“I beg your pardon! I beg your pardon! As God is my witness, I didn’t know,” the old man muttered, and, having looked Natasha up and down, he left. Mlle Bourienne was the first to recover after this apparition and began talking about the prince’s ill health. Natasha and Princess Marya silently looked at each other, and the longer they looked at each other silently, without saying what they needed to say, the more ill-willed were their thoughts about each other.::3/5/1855
Tisch Mills::123874.82596679623::“Look, Prince,” said another, who very much wanted to take one more little pie, but was embarrassed, and who therefore pretended to be surveying the area, “look, our infantrymen have already gotten in there.

Burlington::675698.0275772195::“You don’t want to? Well, come here, then,” she said and went deeper among the plants and dropped her doll. “Closer, closer!” she whispered. She caught the officer by the cuffs with both hands, and her flushed face showed solemnity and fear.::22/3/1926
Moline::160624.3378130655::Prince Andrei, who, to complete the trophy of prisoners, was also brought out before the eyes of the emperor, could not fail to attract his attention. Napoleon evidently remembered seeing him on the battlefield, and, turning to him, used the same appellation of young man, jeune homme,  under which Bolkonsky had been imprinted on his memory the first time.::18/10/1969
Ormond Beach::478846.52180082345::But the colonel did not finish everything he wanted to say. A cannonball flew close to him and made him duck and crouch down on his horse. He fell silent and was about to say something more when another cannonball stopped him. He turned his horse and galloped away.::17/3/1884
Foster::570333.6746780362::“Count!…don’t ruin…a young man…here’s this wretched…money, take it…” He threw it on the table. “I have an old father, a mother!…”::24/6/2015

She’s such an unearthly being! Ah, Boris, Boris!” She would fall silent for a moment. “And how sorry I am for her maman, ” she would go on. “Today she showed me reports and letters from Penza (they have an enormous estate), and she does everything alone, poor thing: they deceive her so much!”::21/1/2000
Midland::149154.27355223475::“But nothing, nothing like this…has ever happened to me before!” she said. “Only I’m frightened, I’m always frightened with him—what does it mean? It means it’s something real, doesn’t it? Mama, are you asleep?”::25/7/1884
Leyden::409570.0150942024::“Why, he’s really a good man, you can serve with him,” Timokhin said to a subaltern officer who was walking beside him.::8/6/1965
Goose Creek::196301.41715322202::“A future life?” Prince Andrei repeated, but Pierre gave him no time to reply, and took this repetition for a denial, the more so as he knew Prince Andrei’s former atheistic convictions.::22/10/1949
Urbana::797626.3069420493::Just then Anna Mikhailovna stepped inaudibly into the room, with the business-like, preoccupied, and at the same time meek Christian look that never left her. Though Anna Mikhailovna found the count in his dressing gown every day, he became embarrassed each time and apologized for his costume. He did so now as well.::9/5/1813
State College::121955.68080827557::“One is always too clever with the older children, wanting to do something extraordinary,” said the guest.::14/3/1937
Winter Garden::645376.4637050754::“They told me you gave orders to harness up,” she said breathlessly (she had obviously come running), “and I wanted so much to talk more with you alone. God knows for how long we’re parting again. You’re not angry that I’ve come? You’ve changed very much, Andryusha,” she added, as if to explain her question.::18/6/1956
Belleville::106193.91445528681::Dolokhov gravely began to deal. Oh, how Rostov hated at that moment those reddish hands, with their short fingers and the hair sticking out from the cuffs, which had him in their power…He won the ten.::14/6/1930
Danville::777169.9845847599::He had barely ridden out beyond the projecting arm of the forest when he saw a fat gentleman in a visored beaver cap coming towards him on a beautiful black horse, accompanied by two grooms.::12/10/1885
Edmonds::889023.6006198106::After Denisov’s departure, Rostov, waiting for the money, which the old count could not raise all at once, spent two more weeks in Moscow without leaving the house, mostly in the young ladies’ room.::24/8/1999
Diamond Bluff::628774.2464958715::In all, fifty-four hounds were led out under six kennelmen and whippers-in. Besides the gentlemen, there were eight borzoi handlers, around whom roamed more than forty borzois, so that, with the gentlemen’s packs, there were about a hundred and thirty dogs in the field and twenty mounted hunters.::21/8/1921
Mankato::599312.4795527938::Pierre could not understand for a long time, but when he did, he jumped up from the sofa, seized Boris’s arm from below with his peculiar quickness and awkwardness, and, turning much more red than Boris, began speaking with a mixed feeling of shame and vexation:::13/4/1924
Leominster::114288.10538210355::“In the beginning I didn’t like it much, because what is it that makes a city pleasant? Ce sont les jolies femmes, *376 isn’t that so? Well, but now I like it very much,” he said, looking at her meaningfully. “Will you come to this carousel, Countess? Please do come,” he said and, reaching his hand out to her bouquet and lowering his voice, he said: “Vous serez la plus jolie. Venez, ch&#232;re comtesse, et comme gage donnez-moi cette fleur.” †377::12/10/1886
Farmington::600557.749510484::“No, you may not,” Prince Andrei said, laughing, letting Pierre know by the pressure of his hand that there was no need to ask. He was about to say more, but just then Prince Vassily and his daughter rose, and the men stood up to let them pass.::20/7/1923
Sherman::596101.6706142243::In the year twelve, when news of the war with Napoleon reached Bucharest (where Kutuzov had been staying for two months, spending the days and nights with his Wallachian woman), Prince Andrei asked Kutuzov to transfer him to the Western Army. Kutuzov, who by then was sick of Bolkonsky’s activity, which served as a reproach to his idleness, quite willingly let him go and gave him an errand to Barclay de Tolly.::5/4/1845
Westfield::944348.0060723772::Just then the arrival of Count Bezukhov was announced. The two spouses exchanged self-satisfied smiles, each silently claiming the honor of this visit.::10/4/1925

Findlay::609419.9704148911::At the end of Balashov’s speech, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox, snuffed from it, and gave a signal by stamping his foot twice on the floor. The door opened; a respectfully flexing gentleman-in-waiting handed the emperor his hat and gloves, another handed him a handkerchief.

Chief Lake::573212.8630021873::And with those free and familiarly graceful movements which distinguished him, he took the maid of honor’s hand, kissed it, and, having kissed it, waved the maid-of-honorly hand a little, sprawled himself in an armchair, and looked away.::22/4/1960
Woonsocket::246019.23515440148::“What do you mean, excellent?” Natasha said with reproach, feeling the tone with which her brother had said it. “It’s not excellent, it’s simply lovely!” Just as the uncle’s mushrooms, honey, and liqueurs seemed the best in the world to her, so this song, too, seemed to her at that moment the height of musical loveliness.::22/6/1989
Cedar Falls::492909.6254183978::The French colonel had a hard time stifling his yawns, but was courteous, and evidently realized the full significance of Balashov. He led him past his soldiers behind the line and informed him that his wish to be presented to the emperor would probably be fulfilled at once, because, as far as he knew, the emperor’s quarters were close by.::5/4/1891

Shelton::906862.8512454847::“Sonya! When will he come back? When will I see him? My God, how I fear for him and for myself, and I’m frightened about everything…” Natasha said, and, without a word of reply to Sonya’s consolations, she went to bed and, long after the candle was put out, lay motionless, open-eyed, on her bed, looking at the frosty moonlight through the windows.::17/2/1916
Hutchinson::116642.27560274831::“No, no, not a hair’s breadth,” Prince Vassily replied, laughing. “‘Sergei Kuzmich…from all sides. From all sides, Sergei Kuzmich.’ Poor Vyazmitinov just couldn’t get any further. He took up the letter several more times, but as soon as he said ‘Sergei’…sobs…‘Ku…zmi…ch’—tears…and ‘from all sides’ was drowned in weeping, and he couldn’t go on. And again his handkerchief, and again ‘Sergei Kuzmich, from all sides,’ and tears…so that they finally asked someone else to read it.”::14/10/1956
Huntsville::57142.35687678426::The letter Balashov brought back was Napoleon’s last letter to Alexander. All the details of the conversation were conveyed to the Russian emperor, and the war began.::10/9/1959

Covington::410285.22312359663::“It’s unlikely that I’ll take advantage of your hospitality, gentlemen, and it’s now time for me to go,” Bolkonsky said, glancing at his watch.::17/5/2016
Sumter::359386.81201199454::And, probably becoming still more aroused because, in saying that, he had said an obvious untruth, and because Balashov, in the same pose of submission to his fate, stood silently before him, he turned around sharply, went up very close to Balashov’s face, and, making energetic and rapid gestures with his white hands, nearly shouted:::24/10/1892
Borth::735123.889619197::“But here, brother, the folk have gone clean wild. There it was all some kind of Poles, all under the Russian crown, but now, brother, it’s gone solid German.”::16/3/1937

Krakow::301365.58007387834::He shaved, scented himself with a thoroughness and foppishness that had become habitual to him, and with his innately good-humored and triumphant expression, carrying his handsome head high, went into his father’s room. Two valets were bustling around Prince Vassily, dressing him; he himself looked around animatedly and nodded cheerfully to his entering son, as if to say: “Right, that’s how I need you to look!”::20/11/1995

Puyallup::853830.8244390581::Though Nikolai Rostov, keeping firmly to his intention, went on serving in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little money, the way of life at Otradnoe was such, and Mitenka in particular so conducted business, that the debts mounted irresistibly every year.

Oakley::249834.965568551::“That’s entirely as you will, ma’am,” said Prince Nikolai Andreevich, bowing and scraping before his daughter-in-law, “but she needn’t make herself ugly—she’s plain enough as it is.”::7/6/1919

Shakopee::64363.47110058627::Again there appeared on all the cheerful faces of the men of the squadron that serious trait that had been there when they were under fire. Rostov, never taking his eyes away, kept looking at his enemy, the regimental commander, wishing to find on his face a confirmation of his surmises; but the colonel never once glanced at Rostov, but, as always at the front, looked stern and solemn. The command was heard.::11/10/1871
Wilkes-Barre::172387.4702382533::“I’m very sorry for the poor count,” said the guest. “He was in poor health to begin with, and now this distress on account of his son. It will kill him!”::23/5/1917

Hilton Head Island::812470.8504300613::“Non, non, non! Quand votre p&#232;re m’&#233;crira, que vous vous conduisez bien, je vous donnerai ma main &#224; baiser. Pas avant.” †251::5/12/1914
Elcho::831851.2171814878::Now it was not, as before, an invisible river flowing in the darkness, but like a gloomy sea subsiding and quivering after a storm.

Argonne::781399.2006347487::“Well, there—silliness! I’m telling you a real thing,” Natasha said crossly. “I come to ask you what to do, and you say ‘silliness’…”::3/6/1898

Lily::948937.5223154715::“If we get to Vienna, I’ll leave it all there, but there’s nothing to do with it in these trashy little towns,” he said. “Well, young man, give it to me, I’m leaving.”::2/10/1935

Carol Stream::924456.642036539::First she heard only M&#233;tivier’s voice, then her father’s voice; then both voices began speaking at once, the door was thrown open, and on the threshold appeared the frightened, handsome figure of M&#233;tivier with his black forelock and the figure of the prince in his nightcap and robe, his face distorted by rage and the pupils of his eyes rolled downwards.::15/8/1881
Loyd::822083.848240939::In the winter Prince Andrei came to Bald Hills, and was cheerful, meek, and affectionate, as Princess Marya had not seen him for a long time. She sensed that something had happened to him, but he said nothing to Princess Marya about his love.

Weslaco::314083.9507327643::“Ah, yes,” said Pierre, with an unnatural smile. “I’m very grateful…Where are you coming from?” The traveler’s face was not gentle, but even cold and stern, yet in spite of that, his new acquaintance’s words and face had an irresistibly attractive effect on Pierre.::17/6/1907

Dotyville::981419.5711774305::As soon as the curtain rose, the boxes and parterre all fell silent, and all the men, old and young, in uniforms and tailcoats, all the women, in precious stones on bare bodies, with greedy curiosity turned their attention to the stage. Natasha also began to look.::6/7/1889
Bullhead City::664101.2506763464::“Women,” Pierre said in a low, barely audible voice. The Mason did not stir and did not speak for a long time after this reply. At last he moved towards Pierre, took the cloth that was lying on the table, and again blindfolded him.::25/11/1920

Not only was there no expression in him of embarrassment or self-reproach for his morning’s outburst, but, on the contrary, he tried to encourage Balashov.
