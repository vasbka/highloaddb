OptoBotics0::540::482::14/2/1805::56.827270332467485::"Then you shall judge yourself," the king answered. "that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom."
OptoBotics1::145::117::23/5/1958::96.87460500996198::But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with:
OptoBotics2::751::505::11/8/1894::69.35194301633638::"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"
OptoBotics3::69::37::1/9/1874::39.79615711745195::"Oh, but this is not on the Earth!" said the little prince.
OptoBotics4::494::347::9/8/1951::55.11243614315785::"The grown-ups are certainly very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics5::200::16::2/6/1852::9.153747560705728::"Yes, a month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening."
OptoBotics6::368::215::4/6/1922::59.19608037239055::"That doesn't do me much good," said the lamplighter. "The one thing I love in life is to sleep."
OptoBotics7::433::339::13/1/1827::26.4276085434636::Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life... For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:
OptoBotics8::474::86::19/3/1871::61.88537618644314::The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky.
OptoBotics9::822::156::5/6/1852::85.34376851838694::"You are a funny animal," he said at last. "You are no thicker than a finger..."
OptoBotics10::702::15::24/6/1864::10.701026185035134::"The planet Earth," replied the geographer. "It has a good reputation."
OptoBotics11::21::18::24/7/1969::56.551963008158815::"Ah! Here is a subject," exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming.
OptoBotics12::396::254::18/3/1955::5.907092570662986::"You must keep your promise," said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.
OptoBotics13::889::184::2/8/1843::17.40935196434139::But he did not answer me. He said to me, instead:
OptoBotics14::865::341::22/6/1834::26.606826999323264::"Over everything," said the king, with magnificent simplicity.
OptoBotics15::119::52::22/8/1839::80.04535668689623::I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him. He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:
OptoBotics16::618::253::16/12/1811::41.67131879692438::The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions  but when one flushes does that not mean "Yes"?
OptoBotics17::519::121::22/4/1826::77.64984775916953::"All men have the stars," he answered, "but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems. For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent. You  you alone  will have the stars as no one else has them  "
OptoBotics18::831::695::2/12/1828::4.154731450688476::The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest  but how moving  and exciting  she was!
OptoBotics19::23::15::3/11/2004::84.92360592813372::And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!
OptoBotics20::622::610::19/3/2007::98.19474823584348::"But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart..."
OptoBotics21::278::246::9/11/1975::85.6494229604074::"Then they belong to me, because I was the first person to think of it."
OptoBotics22::658::23::4/9/1898::85.70429607918784::"My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!"
OptoBotics23::121::81::15/9/1918::8.770663595001139::To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story.
OptoBotics24::464::37::18/1/1845::88.22186507729343::"Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far..."
OptoBotics25::47::16::22/8/1957::85.83629609206838::"To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet."
OptoBotics26::274::92::7/6/2006::88.2904163527652::At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:
OptoBotics27::38::30::9/7/1821::15.384712432642855::"Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you  a week ago  you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place where you landed?"
OptoBotics28::856::181::8/10/1808::72.24807984862314::At one time I say to myself: "Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully..." Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.
OptoBotics29::355::73::20/11/1846::26.743683454358237::"Why are you drinking?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics30::327::173::7/9/1880::11.56541583572328::"I make you my Ambassador," the king called out, hastily.
OptoBotics31::670::645::25/1/1946::69.49037486548336::"Not so small that  Look! He has gone to sleep..."
OptoBotics32::140::128::2/2/1809::3.7652679921389876::"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."
OptoBotics33::703::594::12/2/1848::50.48306101157842::"These are not the same ones," said the switchman. "It is an exchange."
OptoBotics34::544::116::25/7/1995::11.788039682170758::Then he went on with his reflections: "I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees  and one of them perhaps extinct forever... That doesn't make me a very great prince..."
OptoBotics35::648::205::6/4/1928::98.99053747061733::"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."
OptoBotics36::844::286::3/12/1956::78.96169916327823::"I have nothing more to do here," he said to the king. "So I shall set out on my way again."
OptoBotics37::814::549::16/10/2013::31.105623400255844::"Little man," I said, "tell me that it is only a bad dream  this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star..."
OptoBotics38::746::335::12/3/1810::15.5360276316453::"That is very interesting," said the little prince. "Here at last is a man who has a real profession!" And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen.
OptoBotics39::489::465::17/4/1800::86.34582274761368::"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."
OptoBotics40::460::309::14/6/1970::20.551512536176297::"I administer them," replied the businessman. "I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence."
OptoBotics41::630::208::4/2/1883::58.62324692269305::"My cold is not so bad as all that... The cool night air will do me good. I am a flower."
OptoBotics42::264::63::21/5/1956::97.95765104774013::As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
OptoBotics43::134::74::2/3/1834::12.722773498254236::"You know," he said, "I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to..."
OptoBotics44::184::109::25/3/1873::78.11683131312915::"And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water."
OptoBotics45::545::142::22/2/1884::66.84903780807753::"Geographies," said the geographer, "are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write of eternal things."
OptoBotics46::269::111::12/7/1966::66.06185317926058::"Only the children know what they are looking for," said the little prince. "They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry..."
OptoBotics47::867::37::10/3/1962::49.88736983746295::I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.
OptoBotics48::971::435::6/7/1983::67.69731247464017::And he lighted his lamp again. As the little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders. He remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling up his chair; and he wanted to help his friend.
OptoBotics49::4::2::24/11/1966::87.98171413235963::"My friend the fox  " the little prince said to me.
OptoBotics50::250::83::1/9/1830::45.225632550628895::"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to." But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:
OptoBotics51::494::288::6/5/1836::92.4437407050416::Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.
OptoBotics52::172::150::25/6/1970::63.89903598063922::On the fifth day  again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep  the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded:
OptoBotics53::193::123::7/8/1850::48.941574729385366::The fifth planet was very strange. It was the smallest of all. There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter. The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not one house. But he said to himself, nevertheless:
OptoBotics54::638::299::12/6/1924::96.79599034486607::"I make you my Ambassador," the king called out, hastily.
OptoBotics55::531::345::10/10/1859::89.02290098980485::"And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?"
OptoBotics56::287::185::15/9/1912::81.37609592788564::Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling. And I heard him say:
OptoBotics57::467::232::17/1/1897::1.0398773747613332::"It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true..."
OptoBotics58::421::233::14/2/1804::97.94444831191366::The next planet was inhabited by a tippler. This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection.
OptoBotics59::230::222::4/4/1870::89.63904257818417::"I am all alone  all alone  all alone," answered the echo.
OptoBotics60::393::46::6/3/1888::21.281990198335933::Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing abou
OptoBotics61::258::8::1/12/1867::44.98367164184289::"I," replied the little prince, "do not like to condemn anyone to death. And now I think I will go on my way."
OptoBotics62::1000::262::22/4/1994::69.02670933673708::I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:
OptoBotics63::238::149::4/6/1961::53.072818769812066::"One only understands the things that one tames," said the fox. "Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me..."
OptoBotics64::112::11::23/5/1933::49.64436152567304::"It is beautiful," the snake said. "What has brought you here?"
OptoBotics65::397::22::4/11/2013::28.67604377440015::"Yes, a month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening."
OptoBotics66::16::8::22/4/2010::82.80232948527487::"In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night... You  only you  will have stars that can laugh!"
OptoBotics67::556::420::14/11/1824::55.572676625742346::But the little prince was wondering... The planet was tiny. Over what could this king really rule?
OptoBotics68::339::331::1/12/1910::45.59752052516767::The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books.
OptoBotics69::251::17::11/1/1826::27.773057448808835::I continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. The little prince, however, replied once again:
OptoBotics70::935::384::5/11/1944::56.79185991857128::For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time. The little prince went on with his explanation:
OptoBotics71::468::230::18/8/1828::44.91772514842457::"My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!"
OptoBotics72::157::68::12/3/1986::50.13306579062827::He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness.
OptoBotics73::657::78::6/8/1965::98.72351876632352::"You know, it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink..."
OptoBotics74::783::509::14/8/1951::75.70460200740068::Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.
OptoBotics75::121::46::10/10/1995::18.630534336626425::"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"
OptoBotics76::273::33::16/10/1975::95.45861898735318::"Who are you?" asked the little prince, and added, "You are very pretty to look at."
OptoBotics77::881::142::15/11/1843::34.251892884421906::"Not so small that  Look! He has gone to sleep..."
OptoBotics78::706::477::24/10/1929::13.178592973677505::At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:
OptoBotics79::952::414::21/8/1955::32.08311297820625::But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:
OptoBotics80::578::155::7/5/2001::88.32079587147105::But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:
OptoBotics81::57::16::17/11/1816::9.861793509337735::"You are not at all like my rose," he said. "As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world."
OptoBotics82::124::123::6/11/1846::92.37759928843266::"Your planet is very beautiful," he said. "Has it any oceans?"
OptoBotics83::953::317::14/4/1906::97.87624484999495::"If I owned a silk scarf," he said, "I could put it around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me. But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven..."
OptoBotics84::43::26::8/10/1933::13.895191990365985::"I have nothing more to do here," he said to the king. "So I shall set out on my way again."
OptoBotics85::422::37::14/6/1851::5.731294808628173::"The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare bet!"
OptoBotics86::436::212::22/7/1852::23.71258654609746::"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king," the monarch said to him. "I forbid you to do so."
OptoBotics87::578::358::16/10/1976::80.54098709348997::As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
OptoBotics88::53::28::6/5/2015::99.64713571338348::And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, again:
OptoBotics89::479::166::20/1/1842::94.56788733599743::But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead:
OptoBotics90::602::325::18/4/2013::74.44044141935497::The first of them was inhabited by a king. Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic.
OptoBotics91::799::793::18/11/2001::94.89990806057773::"You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favorable."
OptoBotics92::708::497::8/4/1870::30.114743392121223::I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:
OptoBotics93::776::179::4/1/1918::88.09676353083165::I was only twenty meters from the wall, and I still saw nothing.
OptoBotics94::503::39::25/6/1992::3.568982775055185::"One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!"
OptoBotics95::565::338::8/2/1977::64.5149894829456::"Leave it to me," I said. "It is too heavy for you."
OptoBotics96::808::222::12/10/1818::13.703636816441755::"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."
OptoBotics97::360::245::7/6/1979::23.34553745565726::And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:
OptoBotics98::118::8::10/4/1980::67.24588342257807::"Oh, but this is not on the Earth!" said the little prince.
OptoBotics99::326::7::14/3/1984::87.87513459422875::"I am looking for men," said the little prince. "What does that mean  'tame'?"
OptoBotics100::947::61::24/6/1995::24.948827220256277::I continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. The little prince, however, replied once again:
OptoBotics101::488::154::24/10/1914::59.42708273008137::"A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts."
OptoBotics102::86::29::10/11/1998::26.762031921348385::The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.
OptoBotics103::624::312::15/9/2002::75.34838443440118::He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.
OptoBotics104::249::51::18/1/1878::2.8881025841605568::I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him. He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:
OptoBotics105::504::42::18/6/1922::41.65669850600958::I had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the color of honey. And that honey color was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief?
OptoBotics106::920::759::8/4/1886::49.12383222350935::My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:
OptoBotics107::484::258::20/3/1809::59.45033912001995::If you were to say to the grown-ups: "I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof," they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: "I saw a house that cost $20,000." Then they would exclaim: "Oh, what a pretty house that is!"
OptoBotics108::394::300::17/11/1972::40.8237449479109::But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead:
OptoBotics109::141::35::18/6/1936::13.345999158718847::"I don't believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are na&#239;ve. They reassure themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons..."
OptoBotics110::956::345::18/2/1857::37.45009558925363::"That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend. But his planet is indeed too small. There is no room on it for two people..."
OptoBotics111::300::60::18/2/1971::28.755492516812208::"I have been silly," she said to him, at last. "I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy..."
OptoBotics112::618::366::21/5/1980::17.47848161422514::"Where are the men?" the little prince asked, politely.
OptoBotics113::25::10::23/5/1892::6.832219737713796::"Why are you drinking?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics114::802::214::3/9/1826::19.855279351362565::And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower. So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity  which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:
OptoBotics115::943::311::19/9/1882::31.38799286224043::"Oh, look! Here is an explorer!" he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming.
OptoBotics116::323::105::12/1/1852::74.58495325685844::"You move me to pity  you are so weak on this Earth made of granite," the snake said. "I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet. I can  "
OptoBotics117::280::17::12/6/1992::16.562581157393673::I realized clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him... His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.
OptoBotics118::607::166::15/12/1980::12.56662202770018::And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express.
OptoBotics119::547::356::25/8/1802::68.12406538566256::"Then  the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!"
OptoBotics120::928::723::18/10/1921::87.29610195417007::"What must I do, to tame you?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics121::557::167::1/6/1835::27.796207182503117::"It is strange," I said to the little prince. "Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope..." He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.
OptoBotics122::123::111::20/7/1902::88.7841842332287::"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."
OptoBotics123::651::310::19/5/1904::5.496353813684252::Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.
OptoBotics124::184::36::17/2/1898::99.6245124811213::"Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening..."
OptoBotics125::977::477::2/1/1931::61.20892768885502::"I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep."
OptoBotics126::401::225::25/8/1967::82.96174595136293::"Clap your hands, one against the other," the conceited man now directed him.
OptoBotics127::935::11::9/4/1976::71.01258462588717::Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived  as on all planets  good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.
OptoBotics128::805::142::7/2/1943::88.93697054350471::This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.
OptoBotics129::300::141::19/4/1815::12.626168329653487::"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?"
OptoBotics130::662::430::21/3/1863::61.2484275847643::I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little.
OptoBotics131::703::475::6/10/1875::9.273284977967277::"And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure... And your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, 'Yes, the stars always make me laugh!' And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you..."
OptoBotics132::7::5::14/12/1927::87.22816137636897::"You know," he said, "I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to..."
OptoBotics133::559::352::11/12/1801::98.32436578383093::"The grown-ups are certainly very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics134::447::90::19/4/1904::70.87314598214955::"I have nothing more to do here," he said to the king. "So I shall set out on my way again."
OptoBotics135::626::402::13/5/1862::69.51384512854011::"Yes, that is true," said the little prince. "And what do you do with them?"
OptoBotics136::957::652::11/10/1887::79.72778416674537::"It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music. You remember  how good it was."
OptoBotics137::162::52::6/11/1950::68.95564843170419::"Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before any one else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them."
OptoBotics138::199::125::12/12/1817::21.751767415613354::The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head:
OptoBotics139::172::57::7/7/1896::9.345709139224178::"I want to, very much," the little prince replied. "But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand."
OptoBotics140::978::317::8/9/1819::56.56882086625825::And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden!
OptoBotics141::38::20::2/2/1904::37.97049924581718::That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.
OptoBotics142::26::13::25/1/1971::54.52673279115744::So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn.
OptoBotics143::473::192::12/11/1871::2.260658915869951::On the fifth day  again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep  the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded:
OptoBotics144::795::432::22/12/1805::77.63073296757338::"I wonder," he said, "whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again... Look at my planet. It is right there above us. But how far away it is!"
OptoBotics145::62::58::23/9/2011::37.77485759618231::"We do not know that," the king said to him. "I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom. I am very old. There is no room here for a carriage. And it tires me to walk."
OptoBotics146::364::158::20/9/1911::84.02803202853096::"You must be very patient," replied the fox. "First you will sit down at a little distance from me  like that  in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day..."
OptoBotics147::621::489::7/3/1984::17.41725108640557::"Good morning," the little prince said to him. "Your cigarette has gone out."
OptoBotics148::462::207::10/11/1870::42.50939650467777::"Not so small that  Look! He has gone to sleep..."
OptoBotics149::747::451::15/9/1997::33.670246784558::I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: "If this bolt still won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer." Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts:
OptoBotics150::576::116::9/11/1824::86.56832358133957::He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness.
OptoBotics151::100::92::9/5/1973::67.20100550887135::I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radianceof the gifts I received.
OptoBotics152::728::612::25/1/1963::91.01439168931492::"I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
OptoBotics153::732::458::18/2/2011::79.50438760540676::The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anyt
OptoBotics154::293::138::12/12/2000::76.84252373601399::"I don't believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are na&#239;ve. They reassure themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons..."
OptoBotics155::890::511::16/1/1801::74.63591563758595::"Then  the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!"
OptoBotics156::753::174::7/7/1948::44.94508189882129::"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."
OptoBotics157::721::561::7/6/1965::45.04132272488883::"Kings do not own, they reign over. It is a very different matter."
OptoBotics158::100::35::7/12/1844::89.20481332695341::So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.
OptoBotics159::674::656::14/7/1942::54.25367107783627::"That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery."
OptoBotics160::23::13::21/6/1901::43.72282369375164::"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"
OptoBotics161::793::113::12/9/1988::77.12794354415624::And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower. So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity  which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:
OptoBotics162::621::82::23/10/1898::31.45659717952879::You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.
OptoBotics163::984::194::9/11/1801::49.17461092103833::The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.
OptoBotics164::515::41::24/9/2006::26.94521936590356::"I have nothing more to do here," he said to the king. "So I shall set out on my way again."
OptoBotics165::615::271::8/11/1913::77.7129961427269::But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:
OptoBotics166::180::9::20/11/1829::1.7510810771212637::The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming...
OptoBotics167::260::144::4/7/1832::44.164570490644806::I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.
OptoBotics168::732::409::3/1/1933::36.40812199494291::When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince's last words came reeling back into my memory:
OptoBotics169::338::237::23/8/1994::28.740959956113908::He still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move.
OptoBotics170::806::715::22/2/1927::73.18772325690506::"Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk  and the day will last as long as you like."
OptoBotics171::685::121::15/3/1975::47.18519108107216::"I am right here," the voice said, "under the apple tree."
OptoBotics172::482::51::22/12/1965::14.645017977980213::"We do not record them," said the geographer, "because they are ephemeral."
OptoBotics173::446::103::16/4/1854::3.3512125173163043::"No. That would be too complicated. But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs. For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it."
OptoBotics174::962::435::10/7/1817::88.63232235478027::"It is much farther... It is much more difficult..."
OptoBotics175::752::616::3/12/1967::46.35687803747396::I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone's rifle...
OptoBotics176::228::96::15/3/1805::60.09492871168993::But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles.
OptoBotics177::580::360::18/2/2011::37.5077986437935::"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."
OptoBotics178::324::79::25/6/2000::60.33720998599795::I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.
OptoBotics179::336::233::6/1/1919::58.57057190860008::"You are not fair, little prince," I said. "I don't know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside."
OptoBotics180::130::80::2/2/1869::32.065676107214614::"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king," the monarch said to him. "I forbid you to do so."
OptoBotics181::306::209::16/4/1897::41.40398677986921::"Five-hundred-and-one million what?" repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it.
OptoBotics182::771::720::2/12/1899::9.150550470884856::But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets  such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus  to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, "Asteroid 325".
OptoBotics183::5::2::17/4/1849::27.702618552900958::"Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you  a week ago  you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place where you landed?"
OptoBotics184::561::33::11/5/1920::27.99257397346111::I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab. The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.
OptoBotics185::515::452::14/7/1906::83.50212982074929::"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies  and the caterpillars  who will call upon me? You will be far away... As for the large animals  I am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws."
OptoBotics186::72::3::9/1/1814::11.116535857371268::"The grown-ups are very strange," the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics187::632::315::5/1/1910::36.23541321637788::What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!
OptoBotics188::903::470::21/11/1906::90.05214868514693::"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."
OptoBotics189::309::40::8/11/1955::45.35399175263789::"A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts."
OptoBotics190::662::198::21/12/2007::76.94513971402088::"I tell you  it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you. Snakes  they are malicious creatures. This one might bite you just for fun..."
OptoBotics191::955::110::16/5/1870::72.84068489244049::"I am not at all afraid of tigers," she went on, "but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?"
OptoBotics192::923::823::1/7/2003::51.37303111283801::As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
OptoBotics193::414::44::9/8/1959::16.67986165918848::The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:
OptoBotics194::600::419::6/2/1877::46.61517027496802::And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.
OptoBotics195::400::77::12/6/1922::19.056546759278913::"It is a hat for salutes," the conceited man replied. "It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way."
OptoBotics196::267::177::7/6/1916::99.16140198187875::"Your baobabs  they look a little like cabbages."
OptoBotics197::904::892::19/8/1984::81.24334350332137::"I am looking for men," said the little prince. "What does that mean  'tame'?"
OptoBotics198::559::364::24/9/1810::23.38845523852249::The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower. It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all.
OptoBotics199::570::275::3/10/1870::5.675610878615167::"It is your own fault," said the little prince. "I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you..."
OptoBotics200::751::442::12/1/1954::39.62729603500363::"It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music. You remember  how good it was."
OptoBotics201::826::319::22/2/1935::4.5124486092435685::"I am unlucky," said the lamplighter. "Good morning."
OptoBotics202::405::319::9/8/1950::75.52573817516924::"Three and two make five. Five and seven make twelve. Twelve and three make fifteen. Good morning. Fifteen and seven make twenty-two. Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight. I haven't time to light it again. Twenty-six and five make thirty-one. Phew! Then that makes five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one."
OptoBotics203::86::30::25/2/1812::12.079972459167088::"Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us," said the geographer. "The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change."
OptoBotics204::728::345::13/1/1847::91.67175195071746::The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:
OptoBotics205::983::908::10/11/1899::48.081247299653306::"Then  the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!"
OptoBotics206::518::376::7/1/1840::61.663333466548146::"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."
OptoBotics207::322::170::1/11/1822::27.9614957454151::"Men," said the little prince, "set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round..."
OptoBotics208::676::189::11/3/1936::17.844694762768796::And, na&#239;vely, she showed her four thorns. Then she added:
OptoBotics209::594::367::19/11/2008::66.34950381731488::"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king," the monarch said to him. "I forbid you to do so."
OptoBotics210::651::276::7/9/2017::86.45786377610725::"Yes," I said to the little prince. "The house, the stars, the desert  what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!"
OptoBotics211::327::197::14/10/1848::46.4703014997908::On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes. That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us. The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return. But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him. And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of h
OptoBotics212::814::118::12/3/1882::23.982553025232246::"Little man," I said, "tell me that it is only a bad dream  this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star..."
OptoBotics213::343::295::21/6/2005::77.2023953512339::Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has  yes or no?  eaten a rose...
OptoBotics214::583::256::2/10/1824::13.902154372677277::"You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns."
OptoBotics215::319::176::7/2/1840::39.46987284122498::"What makes the desert beautiful," said the little prince, "is that somewhere it hides a well..."
OptoBotics216::601::478::6/4/1833::23.70964066465685::And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden!
OptoBotics217::328::289::11/8/1818::99.32792030361995::And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams...
OptoBotics218::749::663::22/12/1939::65.62754481369333::"The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for spite!"
OptoBotics219::100::96::14/1/1940::75.40184021495865::"But extinct volcanoes may come to life again," the little prince interrupted. "What does that mean  'ephemeral'?"
OptoBotics220::480::261::21/8/1980::48.469849218428784::He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge.
OptoBotics221::586::269::3/7/1808::61.05568037420841::"Were they not satisfied where they were?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics222::181::96::16/11/1927::2.7564665005112343::"You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns."
OptoBotics223::326::263::17/2/1862::21.208925858457217::Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life... For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:
OptoBotics224::97::56::19/4/1927::48.557314571899305::Then he went on with his reflections: "I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees  and one of them perhaps extinct forever... That doesn't make me a very great prince..."
OptoBotics225::193::175::4/10/1898::31.93477832505228::"You are not very powerful. You haven't even any feet. You cannot even travel..."
OptoBotics226::610::16::24/3/1951::52.2369223046573::"Tonight, it will be a year... My star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago..."
OptoBotics227::594::36::21/9/1936::27.059977588311213::"We would have to put them one on top of the other," he said.
OptoBotics228::368::314::5/10/1847::8.78327630656801::"I am all alone  all alone  all alone," answered the echo.
OptoBotics229::667::319::6/10/1952::35.089321911846795::So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.
OptoBotics230::495::282::17/7/1820::40.96355241646856::He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge.
OptoBotics231::123::27::12/1/1909::79.25106740137102::As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
OptoBotics232::462::288::20/1/1880::15.977393721829735::But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:
OptoBotics233::344::1::23/7/1858::44.61523116994092::The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:
OptoBotics234::190::91::17/4/1992::7.427160283745549::"Because intoxicated men see double. Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one."
OptoBotics235::257::169::11/3/1978::20.864248628668392::"I myself own a flower," he continued his conversation with the businessman, "which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is extinct; one never knows). It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them. But you are of no use to the stars..."
OptoBotics236::268::238::11/10/1965::24.037195647949616::"Then you shall judge yourself," the king answered. "that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom."
OptoBotics237::882::137::7/4/1862::29.596094842356436::"If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?" the king demanded. "The general, or myself?"
OptoBotics238::727::348::23/6/1828::48.3897031680412::I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radianceof the gifts I received.
OptoBotics239::345::344::19/1/1953::14.668350637905657::"May I sit down?" came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.
OptoBotics240::51::3::13/5/1949::35.90904171963422::"Those are the orders," replied the lamplighter. "Good morning."
OptoBotics241::950::635::22/9/1982::19.30967977826309::"Good morning  Good morning  Good morning," answered the echo.
OptoBotics242::366::344::8/12/1998::22.280026922247732::"You understand... it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy."
OptoBotics243::834::259::13/6/1847::1.24556854682224::"Where are the men?" the little prince asked, politely.
OptoBotics244::288::274::20/4/1833::55.30918652508872::"Those also are actions too often neglected," said the fox. "They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all."
OptoBotics245::529::293::1/1/1897::94.10957983853237::As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
OptoBotics246::662::372::11/9/1902::47.632023733944365::At one time I say to myself: "Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully..." Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.
OptoBotics247::16::5::5/9/1992::90.20091615922942::"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."
OptoBotics248::167::77::22/6/1997::66.63089597257584::What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!
OptoBotics249::886::863::17/12/1855::36.36387016678289::"I am beginning to understand," said the little prince. "There is a flower... I think that she has tamed me..."
OptoBotics250::453::101::13/11/1993::92.31005169227848::He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses.
OptoBotics251::110::15::9/8/1960::87.74513902341965::So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near
OptoBotics252::275::132::1/5/1838::53.28120258664519::I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.
OptoBotics253::846::139::7/5/1962::24.563309771464002::He could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing.
OptoBotics254::916::255::19/7/1924::59.542177882116974::"If I ordered a general," he would say, by way of example, "if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault."
OptoBotics255::16::15::12/2/1976::8.705979981462185::"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen."
OptoBotics256::107::11::21/4/1807::32.74755932628095::I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radianceof the gifts I received.
OptoBotics257::826::384::1/1/2015::11.595874168220433::I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenienanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.
OptoBotics258::21::15::3/5/1861::94.65816213429021::"It is possible," said the fox. "On the Earth one sees all sorts of things."
OptoBotics259::966::875::8/10/1989::52.68151258723832::I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said:
OptoBotics260::599::19::6/10/1953::97.23739405557285::"It is a question of discipline," the little prince said to me later on. "When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work," the little prince added, "but very easy."
OptoBotics261::728::113::21/11/1941::26.585742508601673::And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious:
OptoBotics262::773::231::18/3/1980::58.14870987164906::Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report.
OptoBotics263::246::91::6/9/1917::42.55051127216248::"Ah! Here is a subject," exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming.
OptoBotics264::507::240::3/2/1876::22.639816295127957::And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.
OptoBotics265::466::344::14/12/1899::98.77027596618566::"Five-hundred-and-one million what?" repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it.
OptoBotics266::883::202::22/6/1969::29.106778215040496::"Good morning," the little prince said to him. "Your cigarette has gone out."
OptoBotics267::386::106::8/8/1964::14.368052817340448::"This is the Earth; this is Africa," the snake answered.
OptoBotics268::960::903::18/12/1996::70.96580702533046::That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.
OptoBotics269::164::61::13/8/1808::24.231822080291497::I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said:
OptoBotics270::504::442::6/3/1949::83.43462068809741::For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.
OptoBotics271::817::555::11/4/1918::42.653788239888854::"I," replied the little prince, "do not like to condemn anyone to death. And now I think I will go on my way."
OptoBotics272::135::18::3/1/1960::38.982053589677676::I had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the color of honey. And that honey color was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief?
OptoBotics273::132::73::24/8/1983::31.833643335117934::"It is not funny at all!" said the lamplighter. "While we have been talking together a month has gone by."
OptoBotics274::443::41::6/5/2018::1.0219794118332293::"You know  a muzzle for my sheep... I am responsible for this flower..."
OptoBotics275::544::350::2/5/2010::48.34504698361663::"This is the Earth; this is Africa," the snake answered.
OptoBotics276::829::69::24/3/1979::16.354891161506867::"Oh, no!" I cried. "No, no, no! I don't believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head. Don't you see  I am very busy with matters of consequence!"
OptoBotics277::191::39::6/11/1831::92.41456760138179::"I cannot play with you," the fox said. "I am not tamed."
OptoBotics278::106::6::17/1/1941::40.20830631393581::"We would have to put them one on top of the other," he said.
OptoBotics279::346::167::14/6/1813::89.9085370854111::"A horror of drafts  that is bad luck, for a plant," remarked the little prince, and added to himself, "This flower is a very complex creature..."
OptoBotics280::100::24::22/5/1867::22.85722711586159::"Dear little man," I said to him, "you are afraid..."
OptoBotics281::160::44::15/12/1989::68.03516238581697::"One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!"
OptoBotics282::375::351::1/5/1848::35.75992594877819::"Not even the locomotive engineer knows that," said the switchman.
OptoBotics283::976::47::2/10/1954::98.66883313872823::And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!
OptoBotics284::808::205::23/12/1820::7.826233139783212::The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky.
OptoBotics285::761::483::18/9/1860::29.983030320847025::"To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet."
OptoBotics286::264::216::14/11/1828::58.09654749027767::"Just that," said the fox. "To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world..."
OptoBotics287::824::477::17/6/1835::87.6749821810264::After that, the little prince climbed a high mountain. The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees. And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool. "From a mountain as high as this one," he said to himself, "I shall be able to see the whole planet at one glance, and all the people..."
OptoBotics288::410::237::2/5/1820::48.44904640378667::The little prince clapped his hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.
OptoBotics289::938::712::21/2/1907::68.26768848592066::"Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret."
OptoBotics290::379::3::25/5/1854::58.48187250502712::I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer.
OptoBotics291::957::927::5/11/1880::92.57069727908305::And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower. So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity  which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:
OptoBotics292::469::146::13/2/1982::98.86404279812886::I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: "If this bolt still won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer." Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts:
OptoBotics293::652::251::3/11/1941::44.55664042207853::"I make you my Ambassador," the king called out, hastily.
OptoBotics294::714::61::17/6/1912::66.49005106247371::He could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing.
OptoBotics295::597::464::12/8/2000::34.59568555724927::The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.
OptoBotics296::107::25::16/6/2015::1.6645442611495254::"I think it is time for breakfast," she added an instant later. "If you would have the kindness to think of my needs..."
OptoBotics297::805::84::23/5/1937::48.7497358454987::"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me..."
OptoBotics298::989::198::2/2/2003::21.215379160870228::"Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before any one else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them."
OptoBotics299::988::645::7/7/1998::9.687236183305881::"My friend the fox  " the little prince said to me.
OptoBotics300::653::34::2/1/1926::68.9432533820734::I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope.
OptoBotics301::678::658::17/12/1815::52.096340680497455::But there is one extraordinary thing... when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower...
OptoBotics302::201::123::4/12/1985::49.532461740618274::er glass globe, he realized that he was very close to tears.
OptoBotics303::713::611::18/8/1873::31.541774531686595::He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To them, all men are subjects.
OptoBotics304::624::396::12/8/1991::88.67863040488007::"Who are you  Who are you  Who are you?" answered the echo.
OptoBotics305::475::427::18/10/1885::54.592566718014446::"A horror of drafts  that is bad luck, for a plant," remarked the little prince, and added to himself, "This flower is a very complex creature..."
OptoBotics306::698::321::21/1/1839::11.237362406268502::Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived  as on all planets  good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.
OptoBotics307::104::44::14/12/1839::15.922211222040916::"Ah!" The little prince was disappointed. "Has it any mountains?"
OptoBotics308::120::118::9/6/1888::24.807192632275243::"Good evening," said the little prince courteously.
OptoBotics309::142::128::22/12/1900::10.322974257156059::"It has done me good," said the fox, "because of the color of the wheat fields." And then he added:
OptoBotics310::915::727::14/9/1810::79.7901086833784::"It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh..."
OptoBotics311::488::311::8/5/1801::80.16324789696851::And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.
OptoBotics312::722::526::2/9/1940::25.371412018294702::"I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine," he said. "Now you can go back home  "
OptoBotics313::577::569::17/10/1915::88.65346878470879::The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anyt

OptoBotics315::172::106::19/9/1832::14.810910824022328::"And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?"
OptoBotics316::796::698::14/10/1882::51.860399724563436::Perhaps you will ask me, "Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?" The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.
OptoBotics317::386::229::6/8/1846::52.801184293901336::Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life... For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:
OptoBotics318::194::146::23/11/1832::91.64550809579842::"You are beautiful, but you are empty," he went on. "One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you  the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she tha
OptoBotics319::583::501::15/1/1925::83.37225720923963::"As for me," said the little prince to himself, "if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water."
OptoBotics320::475::262::21/2/1920::96.33740519838108::"There is nothing to understand," said the lamplighter. "Orders are orders. Good morning."
OptoBotics321::79::41::12/8/2007::68.36522755156605::"Yes," I said to the little prince. "The house, the stars, the desert  what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!"
OptoBotics322::909::582::10/12/1997::79.67675510274648::"What makes the desert beautiful," said the little prince, "is that somewhere it hides a well..."
OptoBotics323::727::696::1/2/1897::19.16953814961285::Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.
OptoBotics324::285::216::19/7/2002::73.99546479982313::"The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics325::71::56::16/6/1806::62.24502966525773::"I ought not to have listened to her," he confided to me one day. "One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity."
OptoBotics326::124::0::19/1/1971::40.66556646612849::"Millions of those little objects," he said, "which one sometimes sees in the sky."
OptoBotics327::224::204::13/9/1840::31.63160643964915::You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.
OptoBotics328::323::234::12/7/1941::29.034147662172792::Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces...
OptoBotics329::920::412::23/11/1818::9.83597337227563::"Your planet is very beautiful," he said. "Has it any oceans?"
OptoBotics330::143::100::10/1/1866::54.01453787498458::"That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key."
OptoBotics331::652::372::13/3/1875::73.30465741226602::"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen."
OptoBotics332::967::838::8/2/2008::28.5658453818753::The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there, 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men  that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups. To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lam
OptoBotics333::933::603::12/1/1825::53.16296018727748::"Ah, then," the king said. "I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order."
OptoBotics334::115::49::25/6/2010::31.110443273906576::"You know, it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink..."
OptoBotics335::494::38::18/9/2003::9.363521745280467::Perhaps you will ask me, "Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?" The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.
OptoBotics336::391::240::1/2/2006::26.050787135457288::"I am thirsty for this water," said the little prince. "Give me some of it to drink..."
OptoBotics337::251::210::2/6/1838::19.72142288466534::I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little.
OptoBotics338::596::561::15/10/1853::51.591366566111994::Then he went on with his reflections: "I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees  and one of them perhaps extinct forever... That doesn't make me a very great prince..."
OptoBotics339::620::448::4/6/1896::53.24502565499717::"This is the Earth; this is Africa," the snake answered.
OptoBotics340::540::471::3/9/1813::96.84443771449924::He could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing.
OptoBotics341::298::203::18/2/2005::89.48974042784197::"And the orders have been changed since that time?"
OptoBotics342::104::65::9/1/1901::87.49750563312335::"Ah, then," the king said. "I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order."
OptoBotics343::663::314::8/1/1992::72.83830413425927::Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole  only these two would live free from toil and care: they would be busy twice a year.
OptoBotics344::108::52::9/9/1930::38.622530290186795::"That is strictly correct," I said. "But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?"
OptoBotics345::509::84::1/6/1936::55.76814314784456::I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone's rifle...
OptoBotics346::718::17::8/12/1915::17.24853166990976::"I am thirsty for this water," said the little prince. "Give me some of it to drink..."
OptoBotics347::949::484::23/1/1817::33.226376613911555::But the little prince was wondering... The planet was tiny. Over what could this king really rule?
OptoBotics348::975::315::2/11/1968::89.98273249827102::"Three and two make five. Five and seven make twelve. Twelve and three make fifteen. Good morning. Fifteen and seven make twenty-two. Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight. I haven't time to light it again. Twenty-six and five make thirty-one. Phew! Then that makes five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one."
OptoBotics349::963::613::13/4/1807::48.12329375266021::"I have nothing more to do here," he said to the king. "So I shall set out on my way again."
OptoBotics350::468::292::17/10/1838::81.10879755222463::The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books.
OptoBotics351::954::662::8/1/1982::56.48275685488278::And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden!
OptoBotics352::733::458::10/6/1961::42.512853445588824::I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there  happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.
OptoBotics353::614::478::18/10/1884::32.60358272294657::The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head:
OptoBotics354::637::225::20/2/1983::34.158319503691615::"What makes the desert beautiful," said the little prince, "is that somewhere it hides a well..."
OptoBotics355::377::368::22/12/1872::78.9020721882642::I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said:
OptoBotics356::507::143::24/8/1869::73.07352708958423::"Good morning," the little prince said to him. "Your cigarette has gone out."
OptoBotics357::592::270::15/5/1946::40.159410709432706::"Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform," the king went on. "Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable."
OptoBotics358::436::164::16/12/2014::29.452016889389288::The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars.
OptoBotics359::324::292::18/10/1809::98.62738586277004::At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:
OptoBotics360::316::264::5/3/1990::31.249792362393293::For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.
OptoBotics361::334::170::2/6/1854::53.16400774586353::"Good morning," the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.
OptoBotics362::471::402::4/9/1965::0.4817160117694952::"The planet Earth," replied the geographer. "It has a good reputation."
OptoBotics363::45::16::12/7/1926::25.836296405937::Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.
OptoBotics364::547::437::19/12/1964::6.09767040158845::"Now go away," said the little prince. "I want to get down from the wall."
OptoBotics365::404::307::25/11/1914::0.060207804473588755::As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.
OptoBotics366::554::221::14/6/2012::2.486883394470918::"I am unlucky," said the lamplighter. "Good morning."
OptoBotics367::32::11::1/7/1938::25.719231324609748::"I want to, very much," the little prince replied. "But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand."
OptoBotics368::560::8::7/6/1985::8.440031969672424::"It is possible," said the fox. "On the Earth one sees all sorts of things."
OptoBotics369::929::175::18/3/2018::71.8534323101258::And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said:
OptoBotics370::402::183::1/5/2007::73.44240342424598::Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same. So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.
OptoBotics371::358::269::23/3/1961::71.7693479825013::"I have been having some trouble with a flower," said the little prince.
OptoBotics372::36::22::4/3/2013::19.186077575011172::I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer.
OptoBotics373::375::188::4/7/1866::55.118080740240195::I did not want him to tire himself with the rope.
OptoBotics374::450::214::6/10/1836::74.50725494866019::"Eh? Are you still there? Five-hundred-and-one million  I can't stop... I have so much to do! I am concerned with matters of consequence. I don't amuse myself with balderdash. Two and five make seven..."
OptoBotics375::951::725::4/1/1971::88.0125281418949::"What makes the desert beautiful," said the little prince, "is that somewhere it hides a well..."
OptoBotics376::786::263::7/8/1988::13.04485140337308::And he put out his lamp. Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares.
OptoBotics377::808::88::12/1/1808::86.17541079355105::"That frightens me... I cannot, any more..." murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.
OptoBotics378::474::435::8/2/1871::75.73746181879585::But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles.
OptoBotics379::696::152::5/11/1983::51.50765342892728::"Ah!" The little prince was disappointed. "Has it any mountains?"
OptoBotics380::155::17::17/3/1887::89.14351381793959::"Sire," he said to him, "I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question  "
OptoBotics381::499::208::21/7/1806::0.9984502468708523::"The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary," he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics382::90::34::2/12/1944::7.775195328250595::I am drinking," replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air.
OptoBotics383::17::3::13/9/1815::8.045185736190753::The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.
OptoBotics384::97::91::21/2/1920::40.633740950473154::"Oh, where I live," said the little prince, "it is not very interesting. It is all so small. I have three volcanoes. Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never knows."
OptoBotics385::227::55::12/9/1978::27.16676229886875::The fifth planet was very strange. It was the smallest of all. There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter. The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not one house. But he said to himself, nevertheless:
OptoBotics386::412::292::7/6/1975::5.397673756910115::Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report.
OptoBotics387::970::446::13/11/2018::0.013613760834618738::I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope.

OptoBotics389::862::409::5/8/1988::25.804064882665323::"That is very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here where you live!"
OptoBotics390::421::119::21/8/1898::12.5218424337318::At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:
OptoBotics391::581::71::14/9/1873::16.892603972295372::"That is very interesting," said the little prince. "Here at last is a man who has a real profession!" And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen.
OptoBotics392::126::22::6/2/1860::68.90224811283726::I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope.

OptoBotics394::599::536::3/9/1892::46.11930023396008::"We do not record them," said the geographer, "because they are ephemeral."
OptoBotics395::802::785::24/11/1919::43.45731527111114::"Little man," I said, "tell me that it is only a bad dream  this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star..."
OptoBotics396::16::2::12/8/1898::50.41136751512288::And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said:
OptoBotics397::30::24::22/12/1850::84.06708224225797::As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower  the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..." And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...
OptoBotics398::731::114::19/12/1924::97.93801448450805::"Ah," I said to him, "I am a little frightened  "
OptoBotics399::184::125::21/12/1948::48.44060359654328::"I am all alone  all alone  all alone," answered the echo.
OptoBotics400::273::26::3/10/1967::95.26385312171011::"This is more entertaining than the visit to the king," the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other. The conceited man again raised his hat in salute.
OptoBotics401::228::166::21/10/1807::43.888055394466896::"The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will  "
OptoBotics402::491::215::10/9/1847::68.58516183540874::Now my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say  not entirely. But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak. It was not such a heavy body... and at night I love to listen to the stars. It is like five hundred million little bells...
OptoBotics403::366::201::17/10/1806::21.48179426154804::I did not want him to tire himself with the rope.
OptoBotics404::523::375::10/4/1978::58.51631567703095::"You move me to pity  you are so weak on this Earth made of granite," the snake said. "I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet. I can  "
OptoBotics405::304::283::11/3/1845::73.39338148826322::"It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true..."
OptoBotics406::47::21::15/11/1912::79.85719436928706::"The orders have not been changed," said the lamplighter. "That is the tragedy! From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed!"
OptoBotics407::312::85::11/5/1968::73.42024290325749::"I can carry you farther than any ship could take you," said the snake.
OptoBotics408::395::27::8/2/1830::56.559591099863816::"Those also are actions too often neglected," said the fox. "They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all."
OptoBotics409::758::357::16/5/1945::91.77578436554217::Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.
OptoBotics410::763::514::24/5/2010::73.65078668688115::I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:
OptoBotics411::854::105::14/12/1953::84.02771062580598::"I wonder," he said, "whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again... Look at my planet. It is right there above us. But how far away it is!"
OptoBotics412::218::126::15/10/1866::93.36697538777102::But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with:
OptoBotics413::375::140::9/10/1808::7.800733498913559::And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously. Then he added:
OptoBotics414::408::72::24/11/1872::44.550269667798695::"One only understands the things that one tames," said the fox. "Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me..."
OptoBotics415::151::57::24/5/1947::53.966469543483456::"Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one. I am concerned with matters of consequence: I am accurate."
OptoBotics416::265::126::4/2/1850::1.9581291728938077::"The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen..."
OptoBotics417::3::0::20/8/1871::47.605255130127645::"Yes, that is true," said the little prince. "And what do you do with them?"
OptoBotics418::530::42::6/1/1853::87.74358206988076::"It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers..."
OptoBotics419::573::439::21/11/1954::83.16633039891084::There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand.
OptoBotics420::24::17::21/9/1919::75.59188017744103::"My flower is ephemeral," the little prince said to himself, "and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!"
OptoBotics421::602::117::20/4/1960::75.7981270674224::The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anyt
OptoBotics422::146::141::24/1/1852::2.8497941830191165::"I can't help it. I can't stop myself," replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed. "I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep..."
OptoBotics423::494::238::2/12/1997::10.971284141522652::"It is strange," I said to the little prince. "Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope..." He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.
OptoBotics424::925::853::13/7/1899::16.74569015808458::"Just that," said the fox. "To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world..."
OptoBotics425::74::45::12/11/1906::24.59260346820862::"Good morning," the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.

OptoBotics429::291::70::10/3/1846::85.2629348189755::"Tonight, it will be a year... My star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago..."
OptoBotics430::823::568::7/9/2004::9.12649666233415::"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"
OptoBotics431::825::690::6/10/1960::13.88088786740017::The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They imagine that they fill a great deal of space. They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations. They adore figures, and that will please them. But do not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I know, confidence in me.

OptoBotics433::16::14::4/1/1991::91.02246865362744::"I admire you," said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, "but what is there in that to interest you so much?"
OptoBotics434::728::330::5/6/1972::3.291232585509918::"That doesn't do me much good," said the lamplighter. "The one thing I love in life is to sleep."

OptoBotics438::95::14::8/12/1935::48.146353103407::"It may well be that this man is absurd. But he is not so absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler. For at least his work has some meaning. When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower. When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep. That is a beautiful occupation. And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful."
OptoBotics439::173::34::17/1/1887::68.3694707844768::"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?"
OptoBotics440::884::837::11/9/1981::56.1041526286328::"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost."
OptoBotics441::110::85::6/6/1914::45.83598387379125::I am drinking," replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air.
OptoBotics442::804::158::24/7/1899::63.326632918611324::The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.
OptoBotics443::808::741::3/7/1831::77.87739425740754::I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.
OptoBotics444::925::33::19/8/1929::9.992538272469675::"Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening..."
OptoBotics445::596::9::25/12/1861::25.242183339755407::The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there, 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men  that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups. To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lam

OptoBotics448::713::36::21/12/1932::9.17202029216403::"Do you really admire me very much?" he demanded of the little prince.
OptoBotics449::105::101::18/7/2007::61.46312803807502::"I should like to see a sunset... Do me that kindness... Order the sun to set..."
OptoBotics450::221::100::1/4/1835::78.936456912986::"Forget what?" inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him.
OptoBotics451::306::211::2/7/1976::29.800434468754933::"That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water..."
OptoBotics452::868::131::24/10/1990::17.615927350910066::I did not want him to tire himself with the rope.
OptoBotics453::816::91::16/1/1823::64.89381238155491::What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!
OptoBotics454::854::340::4/8/1888::25.48026787501311::"That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key."
OptoBotics455::289::217::18/10/1870::55.348928585975976::"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."
OptoBotics456::26::6::17/11/1842::56.65923355773669::And he too said nothing more, because he was crying...
OptoBotics457::704::23::25/2/1992::68.58866432735611::"Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged..."
OptoBotics458::167::19::15/9/1934::50.76386209438518::Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:
OptoBotics459::967::241::2/7/1935::62.056360599725494::Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing abou
OptoBotics460::797::635::10/9/1881::0.6730298881271635::"This is the Earth; this is Africa," the snake answered.
OptoBotics461::789::159::2/5/1985::86.34272414388793::"Your fox  his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long."
OptoBotics462::301::292::16/4/1833::28.176544311255213::"Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear that laughter!"
OptoBotics463::619::55::13/11/1912::50.77586358221774::The first of them was inhabited by a king. Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic.
OptoBotics464::99::34::20/6/1820::82.05776133615458::So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. "Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!" My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger fme.
OptoBotics465::700::582::25/10/1819::81.90085367152984::I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him. He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:
OptoBotics466::368::29::7/5/1973::24.96829924817342::But he did not answer me. He said to me, instead:
OptoBotics467::629::519::24/10/1904::80.60972205631106::Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France. If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like...
OptoBotics468::476::83::10/4/1972::99.7245653392828::"You do not live here," said the fox. "What is it that you are looking for?"
OptoBotics469::442::252::12/1/1925::6.547462610625554::But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with:
OptoBotics470::412::5::8/10/1849::10.618537207031075::"The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare bet!"
OptoBotics471::64::2::4/9/1959::21.047545881155383::"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?"
OptoBotics472::669::424::1/6/1980::72.81609335955164::Just so, you might say to them: "The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists." And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: "The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612," then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.
OptoBotics473::661::326::18/10/2017::17.118860969703597::Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.
OptoBotics474::977::328::8/5/1849::25.728649278171122::But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a na&#239;ve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.
OptoBotics475::980::465::8/9/1804::6.246315276491532::"Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!" he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming. For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.
OptoBotics476::497::244::22/9/1950::30.87126297118674::"Good evening," said the little prince courteously.
OptoBotics477::495::270::19/9/1886::25.149610558455947::But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:
OptoBotics478::212::122::12/10/1869::43.7598919366334::"That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery."
OptoBotics479::855::420::9/2/1979::51.48346794257511::Look up at the sky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes...
OptoBotics480::636::495::24/3/1839::97.55660244360199::"If I owned a silk scarf," he said, "I could put it around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me. But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven..."
OptoBotics481::850::398::22/7/2016::14.606257361279617::"It is a hat for salutes," the conceited man replied. "It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way."
OptoBotics482::198::8::16/1/1952::93.4908200853302::"We do not know that," the king said to him. "I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom. I am very old. There is no room here for a carriage. And it tires me to walk."
OptoBotics483::460::303::4/9/1970::0.8323605431397874::"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies  and the caterpillars  who will call upon me? You will be far away... As for the large animals  I am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws."
OptoBotics484::111::75::23/11/1959::43.508090212742154::When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand.
OptoBotics485::203::180::20/3/1966::55.68197139415284::"I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
OptoBotics486::666::513::3/9/1827::3.2233430830388987::When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand.
OptoBotics487::92::65::6/5/1858::39.49487191592268::"All men have the stars," he answered, "but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems. For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent. You  you alone  will have the stars as no one else has them  "
OptoBotics488::667::162::20/6/1848::47.760758918490566::I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:
OptoBotics489::64::49::12/8/1954::81.27828828618011::"Over everything," said the king, with magnificent simplicity.
OptoBotics490::596::534::7/8/1910::53.30775761411783::"It is much farther... It is much more difficult..."
OptoBotics491::458::261::5/5/1977::9.18691482824785::"But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart..."
OptoBotics492::161::36::21/8/1897::46.93157793966507::I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand.
OptoBotics493::171::8::14/5/1993::52.94162589648972::It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right,
OptoBotics494::878::505::22/6/1958::93.83778211465027::"Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret."
OptoBotics495::623::227::4/7/1870::61.278452951559814::"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."
OptoBotics496::359::9::5/7/1822::71.83240322062134::"We would have to put them one on top of the other," he said.
OptoBotics497::782::305::6/9/1917::64.76544989824933::To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story.
OptoBotics498::62::42::10/6/1905::92.55584563803708::"No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep."
OptoBotics499::216::144::17/7/1950::13.81652808820263::"I have been silly," she said to him, at last. "I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy..."
OptoBotics500::436::395::3/4/1880::93.26979177214236::I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.
OptoBotics501::445::281::17/4/1913::88.24866465511771::"Five hundred million what?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics502::270::94::12/8/1849::67.32517885542742::"Were you so sad, then?" I asked, "on the day of the forty-four sunsets?"
OptoBotics503::883::200::14/12/1975::82.63752904703807::"I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine," he said. "Now you can go back home  "
OptoBotics504::428::245::21/10/1968::24.160093660206407::The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement.
OptoBotics505::969::968::2/3/1851::7.631920093513422::"One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!"
OptoBotics506::631::430::1/8/1924::2.5485863141194387::But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:
OptoBotics507::846::678::21/9/1881::77.28832655807552::You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.
OptoBotics508::504::328::6/2/1889::94.90288639127432::"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."
OptoBotics509::304::237::17/3/1994::19.584048552242262::For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected. He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.
OptoBotics510::983::735::11/4/1916::26.20879982136952::"The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will  "
OptoBotics511::885::536::25/10/1801::67.4302583501887::Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived  as on all planets  good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.
OptoBotics512::18::1::20/7/1854::31.369143059161498::"Leave it to me," I said. "It is too heavy for you."
OptoBotics513::987::531::23/10/1907::39.78808722892413::The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there, 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men  that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups. To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lam
OptoBotics514::739::448::2/9/1814::73.92049258785161::"Good morning," the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.
OptoBotics515::145::71::4/10/1981::53.955948458897595::"My flower is ephemeral," the little prince said to himself, "and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!"
OptoBotics516::637::56::2/7/1881::16.78577327823477::Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It spreads over the entire planet. It bores clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces...
OptoBotics517::569::112::16/10/1967::83.71124870526617::"You know  my flower... I am responsible for her. And she is so weak! She is so na&#239;ve! She has four thorns, of no use at all, to protect herself against all the world..."
OptoBotics518::858::448::22/8/1844::97.54493168966644::There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand.
OptoBotics519::966::673::5/9/1975::58.13936965521281::"Don't linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!"
OptoBotics520::393::185::22/11/1839::35.71297504019858::But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:
OptoBotics521::78::4::12/12/2002::42.31004252221419::"You are a funny animal," he said at last. "You are no thicker than a finger..."
OptoBotics522::72::44::18/9/1866::73.6290689534133::"My flower is ephemeral," the little prince said to himself, "and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!"
OptoBotics523::142::91::21/5/1889::54.455724109070744::I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.
OptoBotics524::392::381::6/5/1904::94.8653008307922::"There is nothing to understand," said the lamplighter. "Orders are orders. Good morning."
OptoBotics525::846::148::23/3/1828::2.3695616222405125::And he put out his lamp. Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares.
OptoBotics526::232::200::13/7/1949::95.88868006041355::I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radianceof the gifts I received.
OptoBotics527::259::198::17/8/2013::33.785886676115396::The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anyt
OptoBotics528::117::67::24/12/1871::41.770125017016426::As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with a sigh, he took his leave.
OptoBotics529::309::233::6/12/1985::34.319818822640514::"That is strictly correct," I said. "But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?"
OptoBotics530::398::4::12/11/1996::82.68955178009575::He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To them, all men are subjects.
OptoBotics531::638::200::9/4/1980::8.88401648581536::"Your fox  his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long."
OptoBotics532::653::559::22/4/1830::6.2463348189615076::"Oh, but this is not on the Earth!" said the little prince.
OptoBotics533::820::413::12/10/1957::95.84593840485437::The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.
OptoBotics534::808::142::20/3/1813::97.55809217130349::I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: "If this bolt still won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer." Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts:
OptoBotics535::971::18::6/2/1959::23.93432271316143::"I want to, very much," the little prince replied. "But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand."
OptoBotics536::818::441::15/4/1894::6.40195073463512::I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.
OptoBotics537::739::374::7/4/1911::96.55690275472776::That was his first moment of regret. But he took courage once more.
OptoBotics538::981::815::24/12/1876::97.57518685516352::"The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary," he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics539::93::45::9/7/1817::8.702561397171149::Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle. The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wing
OptoBotics540::108::71::13/10/1882::46.22652674190098::And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me:
OptoBotics541::500::189::2/11/1816::55.407360943597496::"That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water..."
OptoBotics542::551::24::25/1/1851::6.3321681352330845::The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question.
OptoBotics543::773::397::20/5/1902::93.69988202552553::But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a na&#239;ve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.
OptoBotics544::204::59::3/4/1988::56.56648777220952::And, na&#239;vely, she showed her four thorns. Then she added:
OptoBotics545::909::227::1/6/1862::92.19974586223455::The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.
OptoBotics546::199::137::14/2/1876::33.57059583993783::"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."
OptoBotics547::183::135::22/2/1810::82.91814193310447::The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky.
OptoBotics548::41::9::16/2/1838::61.104780633120015::The little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset. And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored.
OptoBotics549::477::52::2/9/1871::67.02934049772394::"Who are you  Who are you  Who are you?" answered the echo.
OptoBotics550::131::106::11/6/1858::63.058992933190595::"The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen..."
OptoBotics551::280::200::23/5/1962::79.65548886173465::And he too said nothing more, because he was crying...
OptoBotics552::225::224::14/10/1867::6.208983362022469::And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously. Then he added:
OptoBotics553::825::357::11/10/1933::71.8087227425798::I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.
OptoBotics554::900::176::16/8/1881::49.62881939101689::"Good morning," the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.
OptoBotics555::347::60::4/12/1890::7.415278997762076::"Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk  and the day will last as long as you like."
OptoBotics556::977::134::20/10/1869::43.722725438018884::"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen."
OptoBotics557::378::255::9/5/2011::51.089174609138745::And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower. So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity  which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:
OptoBotics558::495::121::14/4/1935::29.121599893148087::"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king," the monarch said to him. "I forbid you to do so."
OptoBotics559::833::353::16/10/2007::3.0588679857449286::"Come and play with me," proposed the little prince. "I am so unhappy."
OptoBotics560::682::360::2/7/2002::70.80041018449366::"I am all alone  all alone  all alone," answered the echo.
OptoBotics561::880::405::2/3/2009::14.662121203444778::The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.
OptoBotics562::971::227::3/5/1865::57.2832049336515::"It is the time I have wasted for my rose  " said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.
OptoBotics563::762::187::9/8/2012::73.7124052584906::"I am glad," he said, "that you agree with my fox."
OptoBotics564::292::42::2/9/1868::38.130235022340486::The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question.
OptoBotics565::945::101::17/8/1989::52.03917010621555::"In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night... You  only you  will have stars that can laugh!"
OptoBotics566::629::248::10/12/1918::93.50301310505571::He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly...
OptoBotics567::114::16::4/7/1929::47.11261064422985::"But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart..."
OptoBotics568::904::749::8/7/1967::58.3059301191218::I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart...
OptoBotics569::228::186::25/5/1826::13.86299462503433::"Tonight, it will be a year... My star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago..."
OptoBotics570::730::164::6/3/1806::70.89112370579815::"My friend the fox  " the little prince said to me.
OptoBotics571::273::78::2/3/1834::15.309624620339568::He answered me at once, "Oh, come, come!", as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.
OptoBotics572::546::33::16/4/1894::28.894188111098572::"It would have been better to come back at the same hour," said the fox. "If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper rites..."
OptoBotics573::890::289::22/5/1892::78.62278820356782::"It is an act too often neglected," said the fox. "It means to establish ties."
OptoBotics574::181::170::4/7/1933::52.21318873908315::But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles.
OptoBotics575::10::6::11/10/1908::95.7394986303362::er glass globe, he realized that he was very close to tears.
OptoBotics576::345::92::13/3/1990::65.94397409198668::"Yes, that is true," said the little prince. "And what do you do with them?"
OptoBotics577::615::494::5/11/1990::81.21521873850047::"As for me," said the little prince to himself, "if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water."
OptoBotics578::972::912::24/3/1957::80.18008914780422::"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little."
OptoBotics579::364::191::9/9/2006::65.93620354149212::"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"
OptoBotics580::166::68::9/2/1962::59.10127066820675::"I am looking for men," said the little prince. "What does that mean  'tame'?"
OptoBotics581::753::608::17/8/1950::75.82259461509784::When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince's last words came reeling back into my memory:
OptoBotics582::143::55::17/12/1801::19.805138295235693::The fifth planet was very strange. It was the smallest of all. There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter. The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not one house. But he said to himself, nevertheless:
OptoBotics583::90::35::7/10/1821::93.08179721300333::"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to." But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:
OptoBotics584::213::212::13/12/1857::44.38346246096879::"Are they coming back already?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics585::941::250::10/10/1827::8.1150823260987::When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:
OptoBotics586::157::92::4/7/1878::37.52360551949961::"Oh, where I live," said the little prince, "it is not very interesting. It is all so small. I have three volcanoes. Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never knows."
OptoBotics587::307::215::12/9/1986::30.528356712023065::"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to." But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:
OptoBotics588::645::550::5/1/1820::4.723962228528878::If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, "What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?" Instead, they demand: "How old is he? How many brothers has he? Hey have learned anything about him.
OptoBotics589::946::493::15/5/1977::1.5355560337532825::"You know  one loves the sunset, when one is so sad..."
OptoBotics590::597::287::5/6/1881::22.67604203210183::"You know  one loves the sunset, when one is so sad..."
OptoBotics591::357::42::20/8/1937::23.333969898937646::The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest  but how moving  and exciting  she was!
OptoBotics592::344::34::3/4/1926::6.657812235789962::My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:
OptoBotics593::54::43::10/1/1963::79.30451447211279::"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."
OptoBotics594::440::183::7/3/1927::66.34626654103221::"Who are you  Who are you  Who are you?" answered the echo.
OptoBotics595::256::33::7/7/1841::13.964842442697222::And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, again:
OptoBotics596::237::214::21/5/1919::84.33935124841953::"Yes?" said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about.
OptoBotics597::30::27::13/2/1840::49.05980393766094::"I think it is time for breakfast," she added an instant later. "If you would have the kindness to think of my needs..."
OptoBotics598::682::474::13/2/1894::16.221815132395246::"I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence!' And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man  he is a mushroom!"
OptoBotics599::856::630::7/5/1922::80.82290249491484::I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab. The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.
OptoBotics600::324::158::7/7/1957::32.717344095662924::"They are in a great hurry," said the little prince. "What are they looking for?"
OptoBotics601::332::19::15/8/1909::33.11600120704519::"Little man," I said, "tell me that it is only a bad dream  this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star..."
OptoBotics602::702::650::15/4/1922::27.526752148090196::You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.
OptoBotics603::340::170::25/8/1824::86.31020565164899::"Those are the orders," replied the lamplighter. "Good morning."
OptoBotics604::774::635::2/10/1837::22.156092867272225::The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.
OptoBotics605::351::311::3/7/1972::46.814176689385235::"As for me," said the little prince to himself, "if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water."
OptoBotics606::575::72::23/11/1999::21.275340013603717::"Now go away," said the little prince. "I want to get down from the wall."
OptoBotics607::958::278::5/3/1828::24.55939549896089::You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.
OptoBotics608::247::200::3/4/1862::82.74608805616981::"These are not the same ones," said the switchman. "It is an exchange."
OptoBotics609::520::199::5/11/1983::77.61525222934036::"I am looking for men," said the little prince. "What does that mean  'tame'?"
OptoBotics610::950::437::19/9/1920::85.30776496341399::The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky.
OptoBotics611::860::7::25/2/2004::59.46583480084584::"If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?" the king demanded. "The general, or myself?"
OptoBotics612::804::614::18/3/1861::69.68115250894155::The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower. It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all.
OptoBotics613::837::800::10/5/2003::52.53891820714027::At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly:
OptoBotics614::509::19::3/1/1889::46.39255565899204::"It is a question of discipline," the little prince said to me later on. "When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work," the little prince added, "but very easy."
OptoBotics615::392::366::10/5/1871::80.20406662585874::"One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!"
OptoBotics616::997::797::23/8/1993::73.72342769392647::"That frightens me... I cannot, any more..." murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.
OptoBotics617::895::348::12/12/1864::61.93900830560888::"Your baobabs  they look a little like cabbages."
OptoBotics618::341::12::10/6/1845::22.59652765932699::"My little man, where do you come from? What is this 'where I live,' of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?" After a reflective silence he answered:
OptoBotics619::103::76::13/6/1887::58.38156142666845::"Goodbye," said the fox. "And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."
OptoBotics620::610::154::20/2/1878::94.29994628291837::"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?"
OptoBotics621::392::183::14/1/2009::25.384328554003776::As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
OptoBotics622::301::187::15/7/1840::93.97249481643823::"Ah! Here is a subject," exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming.
OptoBotics623::385::178::13/8/1875::4.737949844783895::"My friend the fox  " the little prince said to me.
OptoBotics624::638::26::4/11/1955::1.9811028543393006::"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."
OptoBotics625::324::149::20/3/2010::75.82992228524448::"Oh! I understand you very well," said the little prince. "But why do you always speak in riddles?"
OptoBotics626::248::14::11/11/2015::40.225101373182056::"The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics627::130::91::21/7/1959::4.430969841847887::"Oh, but this is not on the Earth!" said the little prince.
OptoBotics628::669::75::14/3/1824::53.48778549683525::"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."
OptoBotics629::967::909::11/12/1962::90.39649110706351::"I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep."
OptoBotics630::287::34::17/6/1955::42.78733818796976::"The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen..."
OptoBotics631::510::370::4/6/1873::15.658007338482049::And, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil. One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.
OptoBotics632::591::289::8/1/2002::95.12576627547759::And, na&#239;vely, she showed her four thorns. Then she added:
OptoBotics633::406::82::24/10/1987::63.62749028525072::He still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move.
OptoBotics634::134::58::1/4/1812::7.879754782758752::And he put out his lamp. Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares.
OptoBotics635::968::418::24/7/1984::80.86997278160271::"Yes," said the little prince, "but I can judge myself anywhere. I do not need to live on this planet."
OptoBotics636::705::241::10/4/1808::43.23804500341056::"He has no way of guessing the danger," I said to myself. "He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs..."
OptoBotics637::286::141::17/10/1950::17.106277310552798::"That frightens me... I cannot, any more..." murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.
OptoBotics638::149::100::17/10/1941::15.466315955340049::I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart...
OptoBotics639::219::85::5/1/1995::15.03926398584845::But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:
OptoBotics640::316::78::14/8/2002::70.16469400940755::And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:
OptoBotics641::443::265::15/8/1923::85.02635455547379::"That is my present. Just that. It will be as it was when we drank the water..."
OptoBotics642::191::180::22/12/1887::43.44212928984867::His face turned from white to red as he continued:
OptoBotics643::934::275::22/8/1859::45.158900283815385::"Yes, that is true," said the little prince. "And what do you do with them?"
OptoBotics644::678::174::19/5/1887::27.459534420797937::"May I sit down?" came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.
OptoBotics645::490::97::10/11/1800::94.16418842379858::"Good morning," the little prince said to him. "Your cigarette has gone out."
OptoBotics646::417::290::25/2/1944::16.717279749674862::"Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening..."
OptoBotics647::614::37::4/4/1823::39.901736338502715::"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."
OptoBotics648::787::57::22/2/1927::40.20522530287158::"This man," the little prince said to himself, "reasons a little like my poor tippler..."
OptoBotics649::180::52::16/2/1878::92.83428268335385::This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly  as if seized by a grave doubt  "It is true, isn't it, that sheep eat little bushes?"
OptoBotics650::331::200::20/8/1943::15.820184263767123::"Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you  a week ago  you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place where you landed?"
OptoBotics651::656::37::16/4/1802::84.85549411031229::And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.
OptoBotics652::62::27::14/10/1809::74.13006039193978::"Your baobabs  they look a little like cabbages."
OptoBotics653::771::272::21/9/1901::61.3960243879076::The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man.
OptoBotics654::564::544::17/10/1857::81.70814080750525::His face turned from white to red as he continued:
OptoBotics655::429::9::4/10/1810::33.460356543461344::"It is the time I have wasted for my rose  " said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.
OptoBotics656::660::423::7/9/1854::45.489756510360294::"I don't believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are na&#239;ve. They reassure themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons..."
OptoBotics657::291::216::21/4/1910::46.12620014586491::It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply.
OptoBotics658::416::18::4/1/1907::22.84303146184371::And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower. So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity  which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:
OptoBotics659::578::77::23/7/1895::80.1144409639234::"I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
OptoBotics660::452::244::8/7/1885::29.75367270215682::"Millions of those little objects," he said, "which one sometimes sees in the sky."
OptoBotics661::207::54::7/1/1958::88.47634811203444::"This is more entertaining than the visit to the king," the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other. The conceited man again raised his hat in salute.
OptoBotics662::128::65::8/8/1997::0.1355461567282834::"This is the Earth; this is Africa," the snake answered.
OptoBotics663::116::15::12/2/1837::88.9923037686394::"No," said the little prince. "I am looking for friends. What does that mean  'tame'?"
OptoBotics664::146::126::10/10/1826::67.85440704187175::"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away..."
OptoBotics665::347::321::16/11/1937::64.57210696761456::He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.
OptoBotics666::290::274::5/1/1964::52.00256941282368::If you were to say to the grown-ups: "I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof," they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: "I saw a house that cost $20,000." Then they would exclaim: "Oh, what a pretty house that is!"
OptoBotics667::625::429::23/4/1900::16.684034414317672::"Oh, look! Here is an explorer!" he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming.
OptoBotics668::695::680::8/10/1837::37.72456729355264::"The grown-ups are very strange," the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics669::470::264::16/8/1901::84.25161548861762::Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France. If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like...
OptoBotics670::657::552::25/7/1999::31.077534564346866::"The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen..."
OptoBotics671::419::392::11/11/1866::75.99467378152347::"Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us," said the geographer. "The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change."
OptoBotics672::942::83::23/12/1874::1.3696410831622097::"Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the place."
OptoBotics673::23::8::19/5/1922::53.94102618459142::"A sheep  if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too?"
OptoBotics674::627::45::2/11/1821::3.292592619350898::And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.
OptoBotics675::868::457::3/8/1989::51.165968675446706::"I have been silly," she said to him, at last. "I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy..."
OptoBotics676::278::89::13/3/1943::27.23860325978624::And, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil. One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.
OptoBotics677::350::39::14/8/1994::76.43836939900687::"We do not record them," said the geographer, "because they are ephemeral."
OptoBotics678::559::75::13/2/1985::15.020971502561153::"Where are the men?" the little prince at last took up the conversation again. "It is a little lonely in the desert..."
OptoBotics679::377::196::24/9/1822::68.41305394231173::The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions  but when one flushes does that not mean "Yes"?
OptoBotics680::37::36::9/1/1801::26.76360142220151::"This man," the little prince said to himself, "reasons a little like my poor tippler..."
OptoBotics681::807::222::2/9/1921::76.67645992387267::"Good morning," said the little prince. "That is a queer hat you are wearing."
OptoBotics682::235::98::8/11/1933::76.52495482796509::The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:

OptoBotics685::950::208::25/5/1855::33.691633809978114::On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes. That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us. The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return. But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him. And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of h
OptoBotics686::404::228::23/5/1961::13.29354911159949::"I can't help it. I can't stop myself," replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed. "I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep..."
OptoBotics687::671::373::17/9/1959::76.15151566506694::He was afraid, there was no doubt about that. But he laughed lightly.
OptoBotics688::336::96::4/5/1965::91.44908013982857::"No," said the little prince. "I am looking for friends. What does that mean  'tame'?"
OptoBotics689::41::6::17/8/1950::9.64233656361193::"You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns."
OptoBotics690::100::31::20/10/2012::91.95016676224996::"He has no way of guessing the danger," I said to myself. "He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs..."
OptoBotics691::436::122::16/9/1894::56.294854015150285::"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me..."
OptoBotics692::195::80::17/9/1873::16.99648015286196::And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman's cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder.
OptoBotics693::632::386::20/3/2014::19.385712486414754::Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France. If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like...
OptoBotics694::172::53::11/6/1981::16.13001809993717::And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express.
OptoBotics695::16::4::10/6/1837::52.51779792317264::"Because where I live everything is very small..."
OptoBotics696::565::128::16/6/1956::87.82261355777953::"Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came," the snake spoke again. "But you are innocent and true, and you come from a star..."
OptoBotics697::927::141::5/8/1865::70.29640643938446::"If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?" the king demanded. "The general, or myself?"
OptoBotics698::523::54::2/11/1812::52.91505542683631::"Are they pursuing the first travelers?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics699::516::56::12/7/1963::85.32580717035914::"Good morning. Why have you just put out your lamp?"
OptoBotics700::469::352::9/3/1862::49.70593318461538::The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anyt
OptoBotics701::1000::522::14/10/1914::7.5709405601023345::"Oh, but this is not on the Earth!" said the little prince.
OptoBotics702::577::32::1/3/1990::8.535118832025624::"And what should one do to make the hat come down?" he asked.
OptoBotics703::254::111::17/11/1875::54.47691909507108::"Men have forgotten this truth," said the fox. "But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose..."
OptoBotics704::680::395::23/4/1877::20.524503727089915::I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!
OptoBotics705::526::177::17/4/2000::58.4305641556566::"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."
OptoBotics706::419::404::19/2/1893::94.49995149929484::I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:
OptoBotics707::373::220::6/9/1950::0.6477807151928139::"The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary," he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics708::171::169::5/12/1864::77.85759786608448::"In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night... You  only you  will have stars that can laugh!"
OptoBotics709::198::172::17/4/1990::13.33210674920906::The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement.
OptoBotics710::648::392::5/1/1977::5.416357453377863::"  Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight."
OptoBotics711::901::758::8/5/1962::29.449731317972315::And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.
OptoBotics712::69::59::18/3/1966::86.22693522868578::I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness. Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.
OptoBotics713::894::533::15/8/1882::28.14601199673493::And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:
OptoBotics714::770::101::8/8/1922::2.3599623607951647::I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:
OptoBotics715::661::552::9/3/1831::55.92107308777818::As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower  the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..." And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...
OptoBotics716::832::691::25/1/1979::68.32442804145485::"It would have been better to come back at the same hour," said the fox. "If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper rites..."
OptoBotics717::717::495::7/12/1849::70.50294140755429::The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:
OptoBotics718::492::56::8/12/1917::33.70905540351637::"Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came," the snake spoke again. "But you are innocent and true, and you come from a star..."
OptoBotics719::508::458::22/5/1890::29.95765299063168::"Do you really admire me very much?" he demanded of the little prince.
OptoBotics720::221::78::21/1/2000::35.02397721213452::"Hum! Hum!" said the king. "I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. Thus his life will depend on your justice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily. He is the only one we have."
OptoBotics721::687::377::16/6/1864::49.00781186742415::"The orders are that I put out my lamp. Good evening."
OptoBotics722::63::12::8/10/1937::63.78541702139023::"But I am more powerful than the finger of a king," said the snake.
OptoBotics723::1000::609::19/11/1945::52.37617645126924::"I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep."
OptoBotics724::282::159::23/7/1898::80.08878081507338::"I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep."
OptoBotics725::82::43::14/11/1835::36.29601287676132::The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.
OptoBotics726::825::512::16/9/1877::51.540076315928395::"I know some one," said the little prince, "who would make a bad explorer."
OptoBotics727::844::543::21/6/1977::30.887904183134452::"Forget that I am ashamed," the tippler confessed, hanging his head.
OptoBotics728::119::3::15/8/1896::45.46014133123091::"I am thirsty for this water," said the little prince. "Give me some of it to drink..."
OptoBotics729::240::200::15/10/1806::57.9641221322319::"My cold is not so bad as all that... The cool night air will do me good. I am a flower."
OptoBotics730::779::610::14/7/1876::64.78070706157999::ce at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men.
OptoBotics731::845::161::13/8/1964::22.699358166399275::And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly. He cried out, then:
OptoBotics732::939::558::18/7/1824::22.307999044208593::The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming...
OptoBotics733::458::257::12/1/1822::73.79119386217616::"I can carry you farther than any ship could take you," said the snake.
OptoBotics734::861::421::20/8/1940::32.186093178882246::"Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform," the king went on. "Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable."
OptoBotics735::901::321::23/8/1943::46.12762140914012::"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."
OptoBotics736::964::751::19/7/1874::14.23541363695704::"Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk  and the day will last as long as you like."
OptoBotics737::796::184::4/12/1873::71.58817797920082::"Who are you?" asked the little prince, and added, "You are very pretty to look at."
OptoBotics738::361::25::18/4/1862::26.009517332721376::He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.
OptoBotics739::41::18::19/4/1969::66.10221475473394::"Your baobabs  they look a little like cabbages."
OptoBotics740::824::773::24/10/1839::20.976811527970597::"What place would you advise me to visit now?" he asked.
OptoBotics741::93::60::11/1/1911::19.677500652107682::"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?"
OptoBotics742::223::119::3/1/1947::91.37794420906101::And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.
OptoBotics743::456::188::11/10/1816::39.869309991088066::But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles.
OptoBotics744::655::215::16/1/2007::63.254577908144924::"What does this mean?" I demanded. "Why are you talking with snakes?"
OptoBotics745::802::708::4/11/1930::9.252666199196192::"What planet is this on which I have come down?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics746::790::604::20/12/1804::66.01290862401896::"That is my present. Just that. It will be as it was when we drank the water..."
OptoBotics747::220::159::16/1/1995::96.98792177997021::"I cannot play with you," the fox said. "I am not tamed."
OptoBotics748::272::4::21/1/1905::21.33146083345142::Just so, you might say to them: "The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists." And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: "The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612," then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.
OptoBotics749::158::143::6/5/1850::47.26262594186028::But at another time I say to myself: "At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night..." And then the little bells are changed to tears...
OptoBotics750::570::271::20/8/1893::22.935433548071092::When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince's last words came reeling back into my memory:
OptoBotics751::610::65::6/7/1857::60.125734032980816::"Ah," I said to the little prince, "these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!"
OptoBotics752::596::307::9/2/1841::61.6164505936716::"Oh! I understand you very well," said the little prince. "But why do you always speak in riddles?"
OptoBotics753::437::186::22/11/1965::60.014261831919825::"Yes," said the little prince, "but I can judge myself anywhere. I do not need to live on this planet."
OptoBotics754::476::206::24/5/1880::59.90333711482354::"Good evening," said the little prince courteously.
OptoBotics755::90::70::5/7/1822::93.5376168785231::This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly  as if seized by a grave doubt  "It is true, isn't it, that sheep eat little bushes?"
OptoBotics756::622::135::24/6/1822::82.50634812813871::So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.
OptoBotics757::119::43::1/6/1813::75.94493396039373::If you were to say to the grown-ups: "I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof," they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: "I saw a house that cost $20,000." Then they would exclaim: "Oh, what a pretty house that is!"
OptoBotics758::795::163::25/4/1916::48.26131185425497::"What makes the desert beautiful," said the little prince, "is that somewhere it hides a well..."
OptoBotics759::801::440::16/1/1955::45.68788789249029::Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has  yes or no?  eaten a rose...
OptoBotics760::602::350::4/10/1919::4.858555983391522::"It is a question of discipline," the little prince said to me later on. "When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work," the little prince added, "but very easy."
OptoBotics761::593::160::19/10/1868::70.00567154873563::But the little prince was wondering... The planet was tiny. Over what could this king really rule?
OptoBotics762::978::550::20/12/1820::38.023639547569445::And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.
OptoBotics763::830::188::17/2/1995::55.22598504477557::"Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came," the snake spoke again. "But you are innocent and true, and you come from a star..."
OptoBotics764::111::8::11/3/1876::6.631692810768374::"You mix everything up together... You confuse everything..."
OptoBotics765::969::792::6/6/1928::19.181923546475833::"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"
OptoBotics766::800::540::23/3/1866::16.21608250082366::"Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform," the king went on. "Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable."
OptoBotics767::294::273::11/4/2008::84.33972600311898::"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little."
OptoBotics768::236::106::1/11/1915::6.862143904487661::I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him. He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:
OptoBotics769::246::30::8/12/1822::37.06204757621221::And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.
OptoBotics770::863::517::7/1/1901::58.37009039045048::"It has done me good," said the fox, "because of the color of the wheat fields." And then he added:
OptoBotics771::442::21::23/6/1831::52.522320763750905::It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right,
OptoBotics772::606::539::23/3/2008::89.6781268512686::Just so, you might say to them: "The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists." And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: "The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612," then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.
OptoBotics773::241::199::25/12/1994::41.29640032968997::"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost."
OptoBotics774::198::184::23/2/1917::48.69215575098932::"Forget that I am ashamed," the tippler confessed, hanging his head.
OptoBotics775::301::286::23/1/1823::75.99460361334668::Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.
OptoBotics776::803::662::24/5/2008::63.16864875708966::"The grown-ups are certainly very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics777::808::793::16/9/2005::70.65393901232724::"Then  the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!"
OptoBotics778::221::72::18/2/1991::63.97163556193476::"Your baobabs  they look a little like cabbages."
OptoBotics779::509::61::16/9/1926::42.239257376071706::I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart...
OptoBotics780::417::28::21/2/1866::15.494821976656548::And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious:
OptoBotics781::622::376::2/5/1920::22.826186200011634::He answered me at once, "Oh, come, come!", as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.
OptoBotics782::581::275::6/7/2006::31.48404893041822::"Ah," I said to the little prince, "these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!"
OptoBotics783::237::89::14/8/2016::23.735149610381733::And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.
OptoBotics784::288::75::12/11/1900::89.66628864654568::"Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening..."
OptoBotics785::47::20::2/12/1932::0.238171127568243::"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away..."
OptoBotics786::733::320::20/11/1817::80.69581341488792::"You know," he said, "I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to..."
OptoBotics787::865::519::20/9/1804::77.94977922905582::"The grown-ups are certainly very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics788::783::362::2/8/1857::52.356033204494146::He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.
OptoBotics789::717::3::13/11/1861::20.443367520052814::"But now you are going to cry!" said the little prince. 
OptoBotics790::701::147::6/9/1963::95.91335680337886::He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.
OptoBotics791::98::24::10/9/1860::17.8964204805651::And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower. So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity  which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:
OptoBotics792::690::320::23/3/1919::13.592853056868936::"I know some one," said the little prince, "who would make a bad explorer."
OptoBotics793::838::262::22/3/1966::59.58966541350412::"Men?" she echoed. "I think there are six or seven of them in existence. I saw them, several years ago. But one never knows where to find them. The wind blows them away. They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult."
OptoBotics794::977::192::17/1/1857::79.42125718724604::"  Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight."
OptoBotics795::115::57::18/3/1969::26.122400422110225::They are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people. But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: "Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep..."
OptoBotics796::782::356::20/12/1827::85.27577398158596::"That is strictly correct," I said. "But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?"
OptoBotics797::412::367::9/6/1801::34.34774527998524::He was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort:
OptoBotics798::501::177::8/5/1943::21.795935789944863::"One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!"
OptoBotics799::134::44::19/12/1823::21.586005917946384::"Three and two make five. Five and seven make twelve. Twelve and three make fifteen. Good morning. Fifteen and seven make twenty-two. Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight. I haven't time to light it again. Twenty-six and five make thirty-one. Phew! Then that makes five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one."
OptoBotics800::588::231::17/11/1927::13.874053720191181::"I can't help it. I can't stop myself," replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed. "I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep..."
OptoBotics801::398::43::5/5/1841::46.50067086497048::But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:
OptoBotics802::679::14::25/5/1887::79.83729650297761::"Because intoxicated men see double. Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one."
OptoBotics803::175::135::5/11/1867::5.420669774621334::"I am glad," he said, "that you agree with my fox."
OptoBotics804::155::99::25/10/2015::53.9612041493308::"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen."
OptoBotics805::671::667::11/5/1842::65.12997934038478::"In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night... You  only you  will have stars that can laugh!"
OptoBotics806::448::290::7/4/1957::28.361781364094917::"This is the desert. There are no people in the desert. The Earth is large," said the snake.
OptoBotics807::507::131::19/8/2006::41.24061798090295::"You mix everything up together... You confuse everything..."
OptoBotics808::127::52::22/10/1825::64.76650148568098::I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab. The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.
OptoBotics809::466::418::22/11/1815::25.929595661444427::"Ah!" The little prince was disappointed. "Has it any mountains?"
OptoBotics810::331::40::18/9/1822::55.2370700097103::"What is essential is invisible to the eye," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
OptoBotics811::31::13::3/11/1877::95.48098876202612::The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.
OptoBotics812::712::185::4/3/1941::22.441859997895797::He twined himself around the little prince's ankle, like a golden bracelet.
OptoBotics813::452::409::5/2/1861::43.449800348364185::The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anyt
OptoBotics814::50::23::12/4/1962::84.30099106128267::"The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary," he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics815::561::233::2/5/1870::75.08940179194914::I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab. The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.
OptoBotics816::564::252::23/9/1933::85.86358569847606::"It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are discovered."
OptoBotics817::593::64::21/1/1946::44.05891446352557::"It means, 'which is in danger of speedy disappearance.'"
OptoBotics818::132::75::12/4/1952::27.0696505705616::I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:
OptoBotics819::96::31::16/8/1847::90.20191678915367::I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart...
OptoBotics820::996::740::23/6/1963::3.726028378209678::In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.
OptoBotics821::211::194::19/4/1830::67.83458799125604::And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously. Then he added:
OptoBotics822::847::792::21/2/1873::37.03202258590982::"What is that big book?" said the little prince. "What are you doing?"
OptoBotics823::585::457::17/5/1811::95.39240883355853::The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little. He had already traveled so much and so far!
OptoBotics824::666::537::7/9/1998::13.692272542467999::"Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform," the king went on. "Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable."
OptoBotics825::600::297::6/1/1885::26.082613871987228::So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. "Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!" My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger fme.
OptoBotics826::470::346::14/9/1880::70.72073469743626::"If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?" the king demanded. "The general, or myself?"
OptoBotics827::112::84::18/9/1942::80.02095205113082::What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!
OptoBotics828::832::589::11/12/1804::7.034419785910173::"Then  the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!"
OptoBotics829::755::374::25/11/2003::45.24655370766896::Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing abou
OptoBotics830::969::211::5/10/1839::26.535176185208044::And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower. So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity  which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:
OptoBotics831::562::304::9/7/1922::64.76369802059489::"Were they not satisfied where they were?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics832::355::24::13/1/1945::65.11279876975956::"Oh, no!" I cried. "No, no, no! I don't believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head. Don't you see  I am very busy with matters of consequence!"
OptoBotics833::38::27::14/1/1939::48.85335641142672::"You are a funny animal," he said at last. "You are no thicker than a finger..."
OptoBotics834::823::341::19/3/1861::54.00898838129067::But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead:
OptoBotics835::748::64::20/7/1928::86.70232435937379::As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with a sigh, he took his leave.
OptoBotics836::115::28::6/2/1812::23.140825119657073::I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"
OptoBotics837::515::96::25/4/1860::11.762345811998099::"That man," said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, "that man would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman. Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself."
OptoBotics838::710::699::8/1/1814::80.69809261078652::"I know some one," said the little prince, "who would make a bad explorer."
OptoBotics839::205::11::15/1/1899::16.889894653231895::"Geographies," said the geographer, "are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write of eternal things."
OptoBotics840::402::19::6/3/1800::56.53204195002425::It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.
OptoBotics841::30::18::20/4/1972::91.22062454460573::"Those also are actions too often neglected," said the fox. "They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all."
OptoBotics842::920::345::24/6/1886::67.04247601267535::I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.
OptoBotics843::435::421::25/8/2000::96.19474889499577::"We would have to put them one on top of the other," he said.
OptoBotics844::69::55::25/1/1815::50.52016751810689::"I think it is time for breakfast," she added an instant later. "If you would have the kindness to think of my needs..."
OptoBotics845::326::279::13/2/1946::60.663724797070294::And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, again:
OptoBotics846::928::704::13/8/1937::12.566032288165207::"This man," the little prince said to himself, "reasons a little like my poor tippler..."
OptoBotics847::596::59::17/3/1859::0.5498703547127337::"What does this mean?" I demanded. "Why are you talking with snakes?"
OptoBotics848::614::577::4/10/1936::96.08646580189928::"Those also are actions too often neglected," said the fox. "They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours.

OptoBotics849::707::31::20/7/1879::46.22112813796135::Look up at the sky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes...
OptoBotics850::216::152::12/11/1800::64.03491877512066::"At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live. In the place I came from  "
OptoBotics851::577::119::5/7/1872::60.56408305963061::"The men where you live," said the little prince, "raise five thousand roses in the same garden  and they do not find in it what they are looking for."
OptoBotics852::771::626::22/9/1846::28.606533458851647::"My friend the fox  " the little prince said to me.
OptoBotics853::779::752::20/4/2018::99.17458154272484::And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden!
OptoBotics854::260::42::19/5/1846::24.39923820819874::The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar.

Grown-ups never understand anyt
OptoBotics855::336::199::9/9/1955::85.51126789957303::The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head:
OptoBotics856::658::22::14/10/1899::63.70729519163362::"Men," said the fox. "They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?"
OptoBotics857::10::5::8/10/2010::51.95141694262383::"No one is ever satisfied where he is," said the switchman.
OptoBotics858::207::123::9/11/1844::6.221979621891327::But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:
OptoBotics859::640::372::10/2/1947::36.55508816076388::"The planet Earth," replied the geographer. "It has a good reputation."
OptoBotics860::710::663::14/11/1985::0.9849124873919091::"Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far..."
OptoBotics861::683::65::12/6/1961::46.10803059338745::And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.
OptoBotics862::928::434::18/5/1911::86.3023015952127::"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"
OptoBotics863::222::130::6/5/1943::42.429485727146755::The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They imagine that they fill a great deal of space. They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations. They adore figures, and that will please them. But do not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I know, confidence in me.
OptoBotics864::558::476::13/11/1871::64.73742970913094::"Men," said the fox. "They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?"
OptoBotics865::600::170::2/6/1918::32.67488994954212::The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colors with the greatest care. She dressed herself slowly. She adjusted her petals one by one.
OptoBotics866::611::575::2/5/1998::29.30024341596591::And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously. Then he added:
OptoBotics867::687::577::8/4/1984::96.38266124364958::"They are pursuing nothing at all," said the switchman. "They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes."
OptoBotics868::68::48::23/4/1904::54.5677630811371::And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious:
OptoBotics869::475::297::4/12/1835::72.36929490752446::As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with a sigh, he took his leave.
OptoBotics870::324::147::5/8/1814::27.825838964215244::On the fifth day  again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep  the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded:
OptoBotics871::397::207::1/7/1924::75.51755612166112::I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone's rifle...
OptoBotics872::545::152::8/2/1910::30.08104596731479::"Five hundred million what?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics873::860::725::17/10/1925::68.54640807664423::"Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before any one else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them."
OptoBotics874::130::4::22/1/1847::19.96967660184632::"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."
OptoBotics875::955::500::14/6/1823::18.07686900666149::"Clap your hands, one against the other," the conceited man now directed him.
OptoBotics876::223::66::15/10/1801::66.9221297343174::Just so, you might say to them: "The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists." And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: "The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612," then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.
OptoBotics877::407::79::7/8/1884::47.1912388700818::The next planet was inhabited by a tippler. This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection.

OptoBotics882::113::69::9/10/1881::86.51337756979326::"There is nothing to understand," said the lamplighter. "Orders are orders. Good morning."
OptoBotics883::171::146::6/1/1890::53.98689023899102::That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly:

OptoBotics886::928::615::11/12/1994::76.28368922347627::I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone's rifle...
OptoBotics887::422::333::7/8/1954::92.31496070047382::And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously. Then he added:

That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anyt

"When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work," the little prince added, "but very easy."
OptoBotics901::530::472::13/10/1826::52.98546470424112::"Are they coming back already?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics902::485::420::9/2/2018::27.671003993159815::"I have been silly," she said to him, at last. "I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy..."

But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all."

OptoBotics913::462::93::13/6/1935::32.3883183302584::It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.
OptoBotics914::144::34::18/5/1870::43.42905463681027::Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report.

OptoBotics916::498::374::19/11/1802::78.87843839647923::"Oh, look! Here is an explorer!" he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming.
OptoBotics917::1::0::9/3/1986::63.962741363668464::"You do not live here," said the fox. "What is it that you are looking for?"

But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him. And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of h

For at least his work has some meaning. When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower. When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep. That is a beautiful occupation. And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful."
OptoBotics928::772::222::19/5/1986::89.0384635808457::You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.

OptoBotics931::693::419::17/9/1829::69.42067445787254::"I tell you  it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you. Snakes  they are malicious creatures. This one might bite you just for fun..."
OptoBotics932::320::128::1/3/1941::81.39586625621043::Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it:
OptoBotics933::198::116::21/6/1979::29.28274001438972::"Were you so sad, then?" I asked, "on the day of the forty-four sunsets?"
OptoBotics934::665::43::25/2/1921::50.865126105964734::"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep that I have given you."
OptoBotics935::520::52::17/6/1953::94.76381211164635::At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:

OptoBotics937::17::7::6/1/1841::53.974855909105734::"Oh, that will be all right," he said, "children understand."
OptoBotics938::975::756::4/5/1879::35.02153216096574::"It has done me good," said the fox, "because of the color of the wheat fields." And then he added:

OptoBotics942::492::74::13/7/1974::2.0609093815104895::"It is a hat for salutes," the conceited man replied. "It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way."

For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:
OptoBotics944::988::616::16/9/2007::62.01529208754151::"Yes?" said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about.
OptoBotics945::738::248::13/7/1868::58.51548766092414::"I am looking for men," said the little prince. "What does that mean  'tame'?"
OptoBotics946::38::24::22/7/1915::14.063047664679985::"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little."
OptoBotics947::731::97::12/6/1990::26.36463100603138::"You know, it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink..."
OptoBotics948::507::465::20/8/1992::22.910571406027557::"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost."
OptoBotics949::428::207::23/11/1824::8.021190473653528::"But I am more powerful than the finger of a king," said the snake.
OptoBotics950::905::411::5/1/2006::90.0614231741149::"This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside."
OptoBotics951::297::287::1/11/1878::33.91071099164428::I continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. The little prince, however, replied once again:
OptoBotics952::59::29::2/12/1813::12.673683348024312::"In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night... You  only you  will have stars that can laugh!"
OptoBotics953::797::89::7/5/2003::25.351618063528758::This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.
OptoBotics954::69::54::16/8/1883::2.515450458295776::"And what should one do to make the hat come down?" he asked.
OptoBotics955::336::290::7/12/1891::74.80127933855249::"I can't help it. I can't stop myself," replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed. "I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep..."
OptoBotics956::932::500::19/11/1979::98.82222543553682::The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions  but when one flushes does that not mean "Yes"?

OptoBotics959::184::142::16/10/1819::63.56433158083522::And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me:
OptoBotics960::96::78::11/6/1829::46.36985081244301::"Approach, so that I may see you better," said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.
OptoBotics961::224::45::18/10/1972::99.28300585871627::"The grown-ups are certainly very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics962::976::96::19/7/1982::87.71952785696838::"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."
OptoBotics963::614::50::19/11/1974::28.061046120537625::"Were you so sad, then?" I asked, "on the day of the forty-four sunsets?"
OptoBotics964::208::192::2/7/1861::18.340402177419968::"That is very interesting," said the little prince. "Here at last is a man who has a real profession!" And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen.
OptoBotics965::261::107::9/11/1893::75.36520571418764::That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly:
OptoBotics966::628::586::18/2/1843::34.16053891791451::"Oh, that will be all right," he said, "children understand."
OptoBotics967::46::40::15/2/1808::34.49733203371053::I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow.
OptoBotics968::870::236::11/2/1871::87.47860567136048::"Little man," I said, "I want to hear you laugh again."
OptoBotics969::233::124::7/5/1910::74.06964691813369::The little prince clapped his hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.
OptoBotics970::652::352::25/11/1915::62.99574802559826::"It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend..."
OptoBotics971::877::220::13/11/1884::72.94560691430085::The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:
OptoBotics972::961::716::9/9/1934::56.07359985355879::"Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform," the king went on. "Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable."
OptoBotics973::15::4::20/4/1807::42.86443324840052::I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.
OptoBotics974::135::66::13/8/1868::12.361378803996093::"And what should one do to make the hat come down?" he asked.
OptoBotics975::521::176::8/3/1885::71.12481700773489::"Come and play with me," proposed the little prince. "I am so unhappy."
OptoBotics976::260::228::10/3/2018::89.71126828418178::"What place would you advise me to visit now?" he asked.
OptoBotics977::611::4::17/6/1829::72.06116070859474::I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall  and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.
OptoBotics978::486::200::17/8/1881::42.05322716690254::"The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little stratagems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her "
OptoBotics979::326::281::15/8/1835::79.07624816183386::The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anyt
OptoBotics980::920::174::6/1/1897::34.83340974443959::The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head:
OptoBotics981::342::192::23/9/1939::89.90815368340549::"Approach, so that I may see you better," said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.
OptoBotics982::44::33::20/12/1837::63.29630306531791::"The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words.

Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her "
OptoBotics983::854::153::4/3/1920::91.3179427360189::I realized clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him... His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.
OptoBotics984::598::554::22/3/1971::68.91644562685786::Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it:
OptoBotics985::33::30::24/6/1849::48.56963453423819::As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
OptoBotics986::608::218::17/8/1879::95.02244178267969::"Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear that laughter!"
OptoBotics987::576::19::13/6/1916::40.425465844667904::"But I am more powerful than the finger of a king," said the snake.
OptoBotics988::333::229::3/11/1839::18.968877554824548::"Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk  and the day will last as long as you like."
OptoBotics989::285::78::6/2/1910::92.90535480133049::"I tell you  it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you. Snakes  they are malicious creatures. This one might bite you just for fun..."
OptoBotics990::979::673::18/5/1806::19.934104650069784::"Those also are actions too often neglected," said the fox. "They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all."
OptoBotics991::719::615::5/11/1897::86.43678852429245::But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch.
OptoBotics992::287::17::7/4/1868::73.09266880148577::"Men," said the fox. "They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?"
OptoBotics993::340::247::8/7/1887::3.554041819544418::"Men," said the little prince, "set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round..."
OptoBotics994::597::8::14/9/1916::43.88776568305991::And one day he said to me: "You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes," he added, "there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes..."
OptoBotics995::679::401::8/11/1845::63.31135438714857::"Oh, no. Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming. As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence. There is no time for idle dreaming in my life."
OptoBotics996::36::5::19/11/1954::56.004519688463404::I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:
OptoBotics997::127::1::11/10/1917::74.28485002056804::"The desert is beautiful," the little prince added.
OptoBotics998::548::200::13/3/1818::67.61641555140837::"That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery."
OptoBotics999::851::813::3/7/1818::21.561145286424::The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head:
OptoBotics1000::920::853::15/3/1823::33.136934034971524::"I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
OptoBotics1001::344::296::6/12/1886::22.962123896373498::So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn.
OptoBotics1002::859::465::18/3/1823::50.85182033209969::"I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep."
OptoBotics1003::384::364::21/3/1880::82.48295952011352::Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same. So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.
OptoBotics1004::491::305::25/10/1851::68.03623247636311::I realized clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him... His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.
OptoBotics1005::709::549::5/2/1860::74.68666276492527::But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead:
OptoBotics1006::565::422::13/3/1903::50.86889510930397::"You are not at all like my rose," he said. "As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world."
OptoBotics1007::209::53::12/5/1865::11.862672716763612::The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man.
OptoBotics1008::400::184::25/2/1853::63.29199612404622::"All men have the stars," he answered, "but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems. For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent. You  you alone  will have the stars as no one else has them  "
OptoBotics1009::270::43::6/3/1867::9.374740849709905::"My little man, where do you come from? What is this 'where I live,' of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?" After a reflective silence he answered:
OptoBotics1010::368::56::6/3/1900::42.76630659218621::"I have nothing more to do here," he said to the king. "So I shall set out on my way again."
OptoBotics1011::289::223::11/9/1985::86.67582430736404::"That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery."
OptoBotics1012::95::69::7/10/1864::59.39559362724596::At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:
OptoBotics1013::635::440::25/4/1837::17.322489270661467::"I am thirsty for this water," said the little prince. "Give me some of it to drink..."
OptoBotics1014::752::666::8/11/1962::17.992912619591007::"I have been having some trouble with a flower," said the little prince.
OptoBotics1015::899::451::7/7/1826::10.07003684673583::So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.
OptoBotics1016::566::295::4/5/1857::9.49444823234542::"What place would you advise me to visit now?" he asked.
OptoBotics1017::846::699::24/2/2000::42.25258543727081::"Oh, that will be all right," he said, "children understand."
OptoBotics1018::64::53::5/8/1919::80.41244929868292::"I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine," he said. "Now you can go back home  "
OptoBotics1019::956::199::7/1/1859::84.41712108836504::"It is your own fault," said the little prince. "I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you..."
OptoBotics1020::977::963::11/2/1828::71.28170049908451::"Good evening," said the little prince courteously.
OptoBotics1021::439::58::11/11/1816::39.11625916455934::"Your baobabs  they look a little like cabbages."
OptoBotics1022::867::810::15/12/2005::45.80935646030504::It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right,
OptoBotics1023::250::6::24/10/1970::55.021018836637715::"I wonder," he said, "whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again... Look at my planet. It is right there above us. But how far away it is!"
OptoBotics1024::399::82::24/8/1922::27.008056456615414::"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"
OptoBotics1025::34::14::20/3/1822::41.38585174992693::And he too said nothing more, because he was crying...
OptoBotics1026::985::511::1/2/1863::68.52163029648473::For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures...
OptoBotics1027::859::629::20/10/1855::43.83132646245335::"Not even the locomotive engineer knows that," said the switchman.
OptoBotics1028::248::186::14/12/1811::26.56057684177281::"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?"
OptoBotics1029::657::558::16/8/1825::79.67368731970672::"That frightens me... I cannot, any more..." murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.
OptoBotics1030::552::178::10/5/1968::28.772272816529632::"Were they not satisfied where they were?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1031::183::99::17/11/1947::37.81924381324846::He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses.
OptoBotics1032::74::11::19/11/1836::37.48392915707343::But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead:
OptoBotics1033::504::486::17/8/1988::41.188961400914856::The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.
OptoBotics1034::115::36::11/12/1879::23.69192050412192::"I make you my Ambassador," the king called out, hastily.
OptoBotics1035::481::315::15/3/1910::75.75133658479083::"Ashamed of what?" insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.
OptoBotics1036::92::42::6/3/2013::25.786694067711725::"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"
OptoBotics1037::72::11::5/10/1832::19.889115506533408::And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.
OptoBotics1038::117::51::22/6/1816::40.324234458300566::I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!
OptoBotics1039::566::531::11/10/1878::19.58979675606659::"  Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight."
OptoBotics1040::114::92::3/12/1948::43.89273591725341::This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.
OptoBotics1041::225::78::11/6/1817::95.19557995516551::"You move me to pity  you are so weak on this Earth made of granite," the snake said. "I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet. I can  "
OptoBotics1042::971::271::6/9/1890::37.80620384933915::"It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true..."
OptoBotics1043::628::287::20/1/1823::58.15981079478348::The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions  but when one flushes does that not mean "Yes"?
OptoBotics1044::925::652::6/5/1987::75.68723685274755::Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole  only these two would live free from toil and care: they would be busy twice a year.
OptoBotics1045::829::426::3/12/1993::67.56747126438138::Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report.
OptoBotics1046::612::354::23/3/1834::71.90893048732394::I did not want him to tire himself with the rope.
OptoBotics1047::945::365::6/6/1959::11.299295676417787::ce at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men.
OptoBotics1048::622::610::22/7/1896::29.12159122614344::"Exactly," the geographer said. "But I am not an explorer. I haven't a single explorer on my planet. It is not the geographer who goes out to che receives the explorers in his study. He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer's moral character."
OptoBotics1049::704::499::4/7/1889::57.71014582958753::"You must keep your promise," said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.
OptoBotics1050::86::12::24/8/1990::39.7126973367802::"Oh, no!" I cried. "No, no, no! I don't believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head. Don't you see  I am very busy with matters of consequence!"
OptoBotics1051::741::329::12/11/1898::62.420479153086205::"I can carry you farther than any ship could take you," said the snake.
OptoBotics1052::237::136::13/5/1894::41.94914067721898::The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colors with the greatest care. She dressed herself slowly. She adjusted her petals one by one.
OptoBotics1053::790::242::23/1/1904::99.46385420242369::For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower.
OptoBotics1054::565::441::4/8/1903::50.56056413098269::He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses.
OptoBotics1055::532::514::20/3/1829::66.33573505280656::He answered me at once, "Oh, come, come!", as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.
OptoBotics1056::23::3::25/5/1908::6.1869476250588695::And he put out his lamp. Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares.
OptoBotics1057::642::396::19/10/1929::16.202324659458345::"Yes, a month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening."
OptoBotics1058::557::505::22/5/1879::63.40665170685264::He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly...
OptoBotics1059::18::9::18/7/1947::25.720156452744035::If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, "What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?" Instead, they demand: "How old is he? How many brothers has he? Hey have learned anything about him.
OptoBotics1060::252::184::24/10/2014::94.9458438734188::But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:
OptoBotics1061::676::187::5/8/1847::50.172200761813265::"Good morning," said the little prince. "That is a queer hat you are wearing."
OptoBotics1062::31::20::13/9/1864::74.6677164449982::"Approach, so that I may see you better," said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.
OptoBotics1063::619::605::20/8/1938::89.07326220152663::"But what does that mean  'ephemeral'?" repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it.
OptoBotics1064::536::306::3/8/1971::54.384422906434374::"You are beautiful, but you are empty," he went on. "One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you  the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she tha
OptoBotics1065::214::168::14/7/1816::63.756263151373375::I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall  and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.
OptoBotics1066::8::4::15/6/1997::73.81811514980427::"You know  a muzzle for my sheep... I am responsible for this flower..."
OptoBotics1067::230::26::23/9/1864::1.987142515517104::"They are pursuing nothing at all," said the switchman. "They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes."
OptoBotics1068::744::722::17/5/1973::61.09772514598304::"I can carry you farther than any ship could take you," said the snake.
OptoBotics1069::326::271::6/11/1915::84.91825946908423::I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand.
OptoBotics1070::695::572::23/11/1851::81.76526292131868::"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"
OptoBotics1071::139::95::11/3/2017::5.110000916145996::On the fifth day  again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep  the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded:
OptoBotics1072::73::6::17/7/1800::71.33319330394733::"If I ordered a general," he would say, by way of example, "if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault."
OptoBotics1073::64::26::25/3/1831::96.45220220801313::I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little.
OptoBotics1074::33::23::12/7/1920::20.79014186436565::"The orders have not been changed," said the lamplighter. "That is the tragedy! From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed!"
OptoBotics1075::290::232::10/5/2019::73.7871634765701::I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.
OptoBotics1076::139::22::19/10/1860::7.977993208497347::"Why are you selling those?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1077::568::308::2/4/1932::32.90627771462642::"I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine," he said. "Now you can go back home  "
OptoBotics1078::500::88::23/7/1846::80.34481500837131::"Oh! I understand you very well," said the little prince. "But why do you always speak in riddles?"
OptoBotics1079::983::126::16/3/1934::39.878256526549315::"It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite."
OptoBotics1080::413::65::2/7/1839::23.56440132335702::But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a na&#239;ve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.
OptoBotics1081::420::214::19/12/1997::25.12000035617531::"It is entertaining," thought the little prince. "It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence."
OptoBotics1082::866::669::15/6/1992::98.04113955515847::"Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!" he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming. For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.
OptoBotics1083::569::69::5/9/1933::24.558283885325494::"Good morning. Why have you just put out your lamp?"
OptoBotics1084::298::269::20/9/1904::63.669914728265695::"Hum! Hum!" replied the king. "Then I  I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to  "
OptoBotics1085::39::37::2/4/1985::76.90638511641619::"Yes, a month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening."
OptoBotics1086::311::251::23/6/1876::32.150389902234444::"It is entertaining," thought the little prince. "It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence."
OptoBotics1087::344::60::1/4/2004::72.9776851336259::"It is your own fault," said the little prince. "I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you..."
OptoBotics1088::658::309::2/3/2003::8.516588925869994::I realized clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him... His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.
OptoBotics1089::789::747::5/4/2013::76.40908132273776::I realized clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him... His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.
OptoBotics1090::146::32::18/7/1940::66.56711600347597::"It is entertaining," thought the little prince. "It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence."
OptoBotics1091::459::107::24/1/1905::90.21683787365113::The little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset. And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored.
OptoBotics1092::383::136::21/2/1979::47.49791288820448::"I myself own a flower," he continued his conversation with the businessman, "which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is extinct; one never knows). It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them. But you are of no use to the stars..."
OptoBotics1093::95::7::16/12/1969::97.07528555429742::"But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart..."
OptoBotics1094::881::39::7/12/1984::35.78638280563179::"Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the place."
OptoBotics1095::234::133::13/11/1849::74.3952950827711::"I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine," he said. "Now you can go back home  "
OptoBotics1096::208::52::2/8/1808::68.01870093369027::"Hum! Hum!" replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac. "Hum! Hum! That will be about  about  that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed!"
OptoBotics1097::616::322::20/1/1994::87.83110089850689::This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly  as if seized by a grave doubt  "It is true, isn't it, that sheep eat little bushes?"
OptoBotics1098::204::99::15/8/1891::40.73022537149063::"But if you don't tie him," I said, "he will wander off somewhere, and get lost."
OptoBotics1099::122::38::8/12/1909::22.279730803569276::"My flower is ephemeral," the little prince said to himself, "and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!"
OptoBotics1100::650::617::22/4/1882::24.338523204293093::"It is strange," I said to the little prince. "Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope..." He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.
OptoBotics1101::337::304::17/2/1996::32.06624167486228::"I am beginning to understand," said the little prince. "There is a flower... I think that she has tamed me..."
OptoBotics1102::718::150::8/2/1906::96.29094973511353::Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle. The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wing
OptoBotics1103::557::198::25/11/1976::98.96522378824412::I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:
OptoBotics1104::132::90::12/8/1871::49.46856115040236::I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer.
OptoBotics1105::760::400::2/4/1876::93.44699898058838::"A horror of drafts  that is bad luck, for a plant," remarked the little prince, and added to himself, "This flower is a very complex creature..."
OptoBotics1106::389::149::6/3/1847::3.9674310930436163::"But you  you come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!"
OptoBotics1107::997::195::3/6/2015::84.47140341215899::"Oh, no!" I cried. "No, no, no! I don't believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head. Don't you see  I am very busy with matters of consequence!"
OptoBotics1108::831::730::24/12/2018::82.9457659748655::For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected. He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.
OptoBotics1109::976::726::23/11/1938::56.096315100020014::"I am all alone  all alone  all alone," answered the echo.
OptoBotics1110::891::310::3/10/2009::66.80276928011078::"Forget what?" inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him.
OptoBotics1111::291::35::14/6/1885::76.19400254886499::"What planet is this on which I have come down?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1112::643::154::2/6/1903::87.86687772663551::"You know  one loves the sunset, when one is so sad..."
OptoBotics1113::773::326::2/10/1895::7.292483567488517::"As for me," said the little prince to himself, "if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water."
OptoBotics1114::84::50::9/7/1878::98.25963839230243::"The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics1115::126::97::20/2/1902::58.24651078236407::"What does this mean?" I demanded. "Why are you talking with snakes?"
OptoBotics1116::851::643::9/1/1953::41.4256295041781::The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books.
OptoBotics1117::974::107::16/2/1956::19.884316618042497::By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.
OptoBotics1118::521::403::22/11/2015::2.2060521201037187::As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
OptoBotics1119::861::115::6/12/1844::58.00028132631708::Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life... For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:
OptoBotics1120::335::193::5/12/1904::16.115894077400007::At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly:
OptoBotics1121::40::19::24/8/1894::31.009552091579597::"Geographies," said the geographer, "are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write of eternal things."
OptoBotics1122::979::975::12/2/1934::18.411887181878495::"In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night... You  only you  will have stars that can laugh!"
OptoBotics1123::462::242::9/7/1926::39.91716410139474::But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles.
OptoBotics1124::946::260::3/5/1890::61.533313303491276::The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little. He had already traveled so much and so far!
OptoBotics1125::628::283::8/5/1962::50.97112521216328::"I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
OptoBotics1126::644::252::2/6/1852::82.80211816979394::I continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. The little prince, however, replied once again:
OptoBotics1127::979::342::11/1/1853::88.67116875820726::"That is very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here where you live!"
OptoBotics1128::826::607::1/2/1851::3.413718892034845::"It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh..."
OptoBotics1129::701::446::12/6/1946::28.689016285605774::And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden!
OptoBotics1130::70::24::19/8/1967::89.50085894333276::I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house!
OptoBotics1131::175::156::21/7/1841::74.05760568346818::"I am looking for men," said the little prince. "What does that mean  'tame'?"
OptoBotics1132::530::246::3/4/1949::69.10238170014334::"You understand... it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy."
OptoBotics1133::745::286::19/6/1875::27.95246850771558::And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express.
OptoBotics1134::931::611::22/12/1833::90.9365934797099::He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly...
OptoBotics1135::514::119::4/8/1835::81.61207837360979::"That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water..."
OptoBotics1136::268::103::11/12/1834::6.876482392222516::"No one is ever satisfied where he is," said the switchman.
OptoBotics1137::31::27::5/8/1894::39.80378282601438::"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane."
OptoBotics1138::883::560::12/10/1890::55.2886074793836::They are like that. One must not hold it against them. Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people. But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales. I should have like to say: "Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep..."
OptoBotics1139::627::534::15/11/1866::67.17617955323686::"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"
OptoBotics1140::101::96::23/5/1946::85.53104674960849::This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.
OptoBotics1141::447::272::3/8/1844::48.02861969478658::"It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers..."
OptoBotics1142::226::101::19/3/1962::24.87622195808319::"Hum! Hum!" replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac. "Hum! Hum! That will be about  about  that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed!"
OptoBotics1143::518::455::10/9/1868::28.90264622351405::"Approach, so that I may see you better," said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.
OptoBotics1144::50::14::9/8/1902::93.80455883996255::"Where do you come from?" the old gentleman said to him.
OptoBotics1145::538::443::5/6/1965::90.0282822575668::"This is more entertaining than the visit to the king," the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other. The conceited man again raised his hat in salute.
OptoBotics1146::635::588::3/8/1897::76.16581536332994::"Men have forgotten this truth," said the fox. "But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose..."
OptoBotics1147::76::13::20/10/1823::33.816671741230394::"We would have to put them one on top of the other," he said.
OptoBotics1148::184::122::4/8/1966::72.04579536746859::"I am thirsty for this water," said the little prince. "Give me some of it to drink..."
OptoBotics1149::948::666::21/12/1896::4.09492418927675::"I am looking for men," said the little prince. "What does that mean  'tame'?"
OptoBotics1150::910::754::22/3/1939::51.59402375451578::He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.
OptoBotics1151::352::55::13/8/1897::68.44162811157601::There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand.
OptoBotics1152::80::40::23/11/1823::12.756085479332825::I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: "If this bolt still won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer." Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts:
OptoBotics1153::721::641::7/7/1829::85.37922900538337::I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow.
OptoBotics1154::119::77::18/10/2014::21.019636953636443::"My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!"
OptoBotics1155::179::95::2/5/1900::16.126746850229033::"Are they pursuing the first travelers?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics1156::860::794::8/8/1950::16.259383793483117::"The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics1157::841::335::1/1/1917::25.21551755400846::"Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk  and the day will last as long as you like."
OptoBotics1158::574::326::19/4/1809::1.2274887279706048::There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:
OptoBotics1159::745::598::13/11/1975::14.215906743762607::The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.
OptoBotics1160::645::324::23/1/1911::17.044459339109153::"Because where I live everything is very small..."
OptoBotics1161::166::116::17/10/1835::69.23917778921435::As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower  the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..." And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...
OptoBotics1162::44::30::22/12/1978::89.1760600395659::"If I ordered a general," he would say, by way of example, "if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault."
OptoBotics1163::869::543::10/5/1971::12.135047888081008::"I sort out travelers, in bundles of a thousand" , said the switchman. "I send off the trains that carry them: now to the right, now to the left."
OptoBotics1164::997::752::5/5/1905::57.251000768299285::For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower.
OptoBotics1165::293::104::22/12/1831::59.17075073888979::On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.
OptoBotics1166::441::400::25/11/1831::93.91243764732764::But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:
OptoBotics1167::132::9::23/3/1856::80.3169338133052::"I am beginning to understand," said the little prince. "There is a flower... I think that she has tamed me..."
OptoBotics1168::328::166::8/7/1912::32.64325659727499::He was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort:
OptoBotics1169::614::306::15/11/1857::0.21892814457361576::"I order you to ask me a question," the king hastened to assure him.
OptoBotics1170::91::75::16/2/1847::44.530980956960875::"It would have been better to come back at the same hour," said the fox. "If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper rites..."
OptoBotics1171::530::360::18/9/1810::18.65637686477909::"What makes the desert beautiful," said the little prince, "is that somewhere it hides a well..."
OptoBotics1172::944::106::9/6/1944::65.59115417874051::But there is one extraordinary thing... when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower...
OptoBotics1173::342::130::8/9/1863::8.351479282442753::"I am not at all afraid of tigers," she went on, "but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?"
OptoBotics1174::50::45::10/8/1965::55.251082175991264::"I think it is time for breakfast," she added an instant later. "If you would have the kindness to think of my needs..."
OptoBotics1175::420::6::4/5/1997::60.23129713768939::"Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours. When you get an idea before any one else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours. So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them."
OptoBotics1176::366::362::11/5/1879::43.43607047641201::I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there  happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.
OptoBotics1177::832::453::6/12/1802::41.04449185024499::"Why are you drinking?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics1178::144::67::10/8/1805::35.913751395460636::"Yes, that is true," said the little prince. "And what do you do with them?"
OptoBotics1179::761::742::6/9/1925::94.78802974451015::"Who are you  Who are you  Who are you?" answered the echo.
OptoBotics1180::54::47::2/6/1861::36.74194993798648::"And the orders have been changed since that time?"
OptoBotics1181::870::799::16/10/1855::7.416514498932669::"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away..."
OptoBotics1182::493::39::20/5/1949::89.75271248756991::"That man," said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, "that man would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman. Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself."
OptoBotics1183::633::519::10/9/1944::59.70195256086329::"Good morning. Why have you just put out your lamp?"
OptoBotics1184::674::163::17/8/1802::15.540706211628674::I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenienanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.
OptoBotics1185::886::722::18/5/1920::35.005956643945666::"And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found. It is better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for you. And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens... they will all be your friends. And, besides, I am going to make you a present..."
OptoBotics1186::911::278::14/8/1856::18.079851643983204::"You are a funny animal," he said at last. "You are no thicker than a finger..."
OptoBotics1187::975::392::3/2/1834::73.58622595663613::"They are pursuing nothing at all," said the switchman. "They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes."
OptoBotics1188::370::19::11/12/1872::81.12402492855625::"It means, 'which is in danger of speedy disappearance.'"
OptoBotics1189::581::477::20/10/2004::87.65753064458627::"Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you  a week ago  you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place where you landed?"
OptoBotics1190::231::220::24/10/1856::41.15287781357675::"That is very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here where you live!"
OptoBotics1191::802::503::9/11/1895::28.642152253699628::"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."
OptoBotics1192::267::81::1/4/1849::78.96236402858777::"I wonder," he said, "whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again... Look at my planet. It is right there above us. But how far away it is!"
OptoBotics1193::731::73::8/12/1835::83.96335719100888::"But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells..."
OptoBotics1194::504::182::17/1/1989::51.364557246066575::"The grown-ups are certainly very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics1195::325::186::2/2/1800::43.83565333311793::"Hum! Hum!" said the king. "I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. Thus his life will depend on your justice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily. He is the only one we have."
OptoBotics1196::428::347::1/1/1951::15.832099329208283::"Ah!" The little prince was disappointed. "Has it any mountains?"
OptoBotics1197::186::107::1/9/1907::77.68029676832174::He still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move.
OptoBotics1198::958::330::16/11/1841::16.450432339622402::"I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
OptoBotics1199::26::2::18/10/1841::81.37714155672042::"The planet Earth," replied the geographer. "It has a good reputation."
OptoBotics1200::664::39::23/8/1820::82.19094665145191::The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest  but how moving  and exciting  she was!
OptoBotics1201::157::14::14/4/1877::62.67651984272575::I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.
OptoBotics1202::270::235::21/2/2016::39.2737918770727::"Not even the locomotive engineer knows that," said the switchman.
OptoBotics1203::304::95::14/10/1978::91.12948461110952::Look up at the sky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes...
OptoBotics1204::813::626::8/1/1908::28.90909126398602::So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. "Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!" My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger fme.
OptoBotics1205::111::15::18/12/1930::76.07821012435065::"Ah! Here is a subject," exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming.
OptoBotics1206::996::350::11/6/1843::60.85536873183537::There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand.
OptoBotics1207::263::120::18/6/1909::14.722521747773287::"Those are the orders," replied the lamplighter. "Good morning."
OptoBotics1208::505::254::3/12/1835::64.57291004681086::"Men," said the fox. "They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?"
OptoBotics1209::917::579::5/10/1941::75.4743715169235::"Good morning," the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.
OptoBotics1210::598::208::13/5/2007::23.07771462637076::"To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet."
OptoBotics1211::611::607::20/2/1917::28.79546701806097::And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.
OptoBotics1212::400::353::7/4/1833::21.58485819341204::"Forget that I am ashamed," the tippler confessed, hanging his head.
OptoBotics1213::123::50::6/4/1918::6.574134767992068::And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower. So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity  which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:
OptoBotics1214::821::337::11/12/1945::7.601209470446335::"One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!"
OptoBotics1215::991::24::3/5/1923::18.809609612640877::And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me:
OptoBotics1216::599::314::25/4/1929::14.013582720155249::I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone's rifle...
OptoBotics1217::875::479::2/8/1875::17.148819564837183::And one day he said to me: "You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes," he added, "there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes..."
OptoBotics1218::440::249::7/2/1826::57.72842579054802::"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies  and the caterpillars  who will call upon me? You will be far away... As for the large animals  I am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws."
OptoBotics1219::888::139::16/12/1880::74.66639155218647::"Men?" she echoed. "I think there are six or seven of them in existence. I saw them, several years ago. But one never knows where to find them. The wind blows them away. They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult."
OptoBotics1220::953::544::3/12/1810::32.057882650553736::I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.
OptoBotics1221::849::813::3/3/2015::28.52281582078883::"I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine," he said. "Now you can go back home  "
OptoBotics1222::712::326::9/7/1916::99.99940020734302::And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, again:
OptoBotics1223::759::252::25/4/1875::87.81786991911564::The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming...
OptoBotics1224::467::402::25/2/1966::26.978867277766017::"It is strange," I said to the little prince. "Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope..." He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.
OptoBotics1225::142::45::20/6/2015::3.7077800342698364::"It has done me good," said the fox, "because of the color of the wheat fields." And then he added:
OptoBotics1226::754::369::19/10/1958::65.64595009448193::This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.
OptoBotics1227::294::191::19/4/1899::2.817717578346557::I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone's rifle...
OptoBotics1228::836::252::4/5/1970::91.07884763715997::"Oh, but I have looked already!" said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet. On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all...
OptoBotics1229::247::206::7/7/1877::99.60417039007548::"Five hundred million what?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1230::587::260::17/3/1836::67.14681122059315::For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected. He tolerated no disobedience. He was an absolute monarch. But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.
OptoBotics1231::183::74::9/8/1947::31.81055596332677::"Oh, that will be all right," he said, "children understand."
OptoBotics1232::355::283::2/2/1822::98.56444557049264::"Good evening," said the little prince courteously.
OptoBotics1233::696::425::24/6/1839::25.502239576829222::As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.
OptoBotics1234::738::625::15/10/1946::58.529046483770465::Then he went on with his reflections: "I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees  and one of them perhaps extinct forever... That doesn't make me a very great prince..."
OptoBotics1235::349::240::14/3/1843::3.857648319833862::The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They imagine that they fill a great deal of space. They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations. They adore figures, and that will please them. But do not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I know, confidence in me.
OptoBotics1236::451::71::2/9/1818::89.13188456125536::"Five hundred million what?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1237::703::425::4/12/1861::70.13602796220141::"Ah," I said to the little prince, "these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!"
OptoBotics1238::279::10::16/11/1811::77.95097606138239::"It means, 'which is in danger of speedy disappearance.'"
OptoBotics1239::578::168::15/12/1948::18.580678394470183::"Hum! Hum!" said the king. "I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. Thus his life will depend on your justice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily. He is the only one we have."
OptoBotics1240::483::25::15/6/1906::83.19384450150604::"Oh! I understand you very well," said the little prince. "But why do you always speak in riddles?"
OptoBotics1241::820::527::14/12/1813::0.2972856262574264::In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."
OptoBotics1242::429::220::23/5/1970::63.10330409437862::But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:
OptoBotics1243::971::345::22/1/1800::54.4521437455583::Just so, you might say to them: "The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists." And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: "The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612," then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.
OptoBotics1244::574::316::14/10/1899::3.5253795519890607::He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses.
OptoBotics1245::688::35::4/2/1892::43.216318832857034::I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.
OptoBotics1246::537::478::16/6/1841::55.55508618499889::"Where are the men?" the little prince asked, politely.
OptoBotics1247::283::107::24/3/2007::66.92727295179944::"That frightens me... I cannot, any more..." murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.
OptoBotics1248::506::233::14/4/1877::49.93731494222451::"My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!"
OptoBotics1249::405::20::23/7/1932::29.376152920281882::But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:
OptoBotics1250::643::573::17/9/1982::99.77972072525286::"To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet."
OptoBotics1251::605::249::11/5/1859::42.124278042799425::Then he went on with his reflections: "I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees  and one of them perhaps extinct forever... That doesn't make me a very great prince..."
OptoBotics1252::372::113::1/3/1977::98.91118587489612::Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same. So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.
OptoBotics1253::716::687::4/6/1938::53.735399842021806::"Then  the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!"
OptoBotics1254::13::9::1/2/1969::84.42937264918554::"Kings do not own, they reign over. It is a very different matter."
OptoBotics1255::378::331::9/11/2003::58.92308413814092::Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:
OptoBotics1256::989::268::20/7/1848::87.27830977477427::"I can't help it. I can't stop myself," replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed. "I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep..."
OptoBotics1257::776::57::1/4/2000::69.17147993696389::But there is one extraordinary thing... when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower...
OptoBotics1258::462::246::10/6/1931::2.3311896823148937::But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with:
OptoBotics1259::347::180::14/8/1844::32.50984615744981::"Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening..."
OptoBotics1260::200::155::20/6/1818::52.91192856196426::"You understand... it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy."
OptoBotics1261::343::211::11/6/1974::66.59175142285333::I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.
OptoBotics1262::385::63::3/7/1864::38.42312261193669::"Those also are actions too often neglected," said the fox. "They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all."
OptoBotics1263::569::169::22/7/1864::1.3593082811759083::"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little."
OptoBotics1264::767::462::19/2/1879::5.109047448611137::"It is an act too often neglected," said the fox. "It means to establish ties."
OptoBotics1265::128::127::10/4/1993::52.0543251106492::"At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live. In the place I came from  "
OptoBotics1266::723::455::20/9/1984::16.892425554894896::"To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet."
OptoBotics1267::146::134::11/2/1822::97.52058170152826::The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:
OptoBotics1268::271::227::7/12/1920::38.7203050159748::"You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favorable."
OptoBotics1269::334::159::20/3/2008::88.50697672026094::"It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true..."
OptoBotics1270::676::666::20/11/1926::21.665225425851354::"It is entertaining," thought the little prince. "It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence."
OptoBotics1271::747::543::23/3/1814::72.19583334036581::"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"
OptoBotics1272::864::464::8/2/1995::5.47186891714847::"It is beautiful," the snake said. "What has brought you here?"
OptoBotics1273::41::28::9/9/1966::93.88932490398146::"Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you  a week ago  you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place where you landed?"
OptoBotics1274::460::436::1/6/1824::8.742376021175268::"This is the desert. There are no people in the desert. The Earth is large," said the snake.
OptoBotics1275::724::290::19/3/1854::35.45673971700071::"There are no tigers on my planet," the little prince objected. "And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds."
OptoBotics1276::376::139::23/1/1948::9.5427460848301::"Those are the orders," replied the lamplighter. "Good morning."
OptoBotics1277::959::295::21/10/1951::90.50650936987242::"But now you are going to cry!" said the little prince. 
OptoBotics1278::106::51::22/2/1886::91.37259356290552::"You have plans that I do not know about," I said.
OptoBotics1279::130::89::1/7/1969::53.47453595483338::"It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh..."
OptoBotics1280::511::215::24/10/1917::42.57668844493101::And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously. Then he added:
OptoBotics1281::555::202::5/7/1865::98.31131265611732::But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead:
OptoBotics1282::512::259::14/3/1906::85.34707446546219::"Tonight, it will be a year... My star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago..."
OptoBotics1283::892::8::18/10/1905::18.174736633011822::But at another time I say to myself: "At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night..." And then the little bells are changed to tears...
OptoBotics1284::703::146::11/4/1948::39.967042383855315::"Ashamed of drinking!" The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence.
OptoBotics1285::753::362::25/10/1970::2.9997220193980545::And he lighted his lamp again. As the little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders. He remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling up his chair; and he wanted to help his friend.
OptoBotics1286::411::393::16/12/1859::60.411612908634005::He breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again:
OptoBotics1287::172::130::3/5/1917::22.8309847200315::"The desert is beautiful," the little prince added.
OptoBotics1288::996::835::21/3/1818::55.93781643375304::"What place would you advise me to visit now?" he asked.
OptoBotics1289::231::131::18/1/1960::38.45311469915752::"I administer them," replied the businessman. "I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence."
OptoBotics1290::27::14::15/9/2014::83.0648417069093::What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!
OptoBotics1291::199::174::1/7/1813::52.91487792340297::"And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water."
OptoBotics1292::880::411::18/5/1894::0.6573040236562799::"Oh, where I live," said the little prince, "it is not very interesting. It is all so small. I have three volcanoes. Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never knows."
OptoBotics1293::230::75::2/11/1945::11.9525771006332::"It is your own fault," said the little prince. "I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you..."
OptoBotics1294::452::449::8/12/1836::16.101626042719786::"What is that big book?" said the little prince. "What are you doing?"
OptoBotics1295::221::138::15/2/1835::65.88831632475976::"I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence!' And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man  he is a mushroom!"
OptoBotics1296::793::477::25/6/1894::12.09564370525914::"I have been having some trouble with a flower," said the little prince.
OptoBotics1297::224::27::12/2/1887::54.84378847778936::"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane."
OptoBotics1298::470::205::20/4/1840::44.676984828755664::"If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?" the king demanded. "The general, or myself?"
OptoBotics1299::434::249::21/4/2001::92.63899128082411::"Forget what?" inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him.
OptoBotics1300::35::23::6/1/1904::18.135690414365303::"It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite."
OptoBotics1301::972::571::17/6/1884::84.53440954937456::For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures...
OptoBotics1302::874::141::19/6/1937::67.05034204881837::"It is not funny at all!" said the lamplighter. "While we have been talking together a month has gone by."
OptoBotics1303::269::46::10/4/1889::30.44596683824211::"May I sit down?" came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.
OptoBotics1304::620::442::5/6/2019::61.24289755500942::"It is entertaining," thought the little prince. "It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence."
OptoBotics1305::598::515::14/12/1876::92.76286859520559::"Oh, that will be all right," he said, "children understand."
OptoBotics1306::229::78::18/10/1818::41.69748516689481::"Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?"
OptoBotics1307::104::4::19/8/1923::65.99597505580388::But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:
OptoBotics1308::99::47::19/9/1924::68.06689714493533::By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.
OptoBotics1309::217::29::23/7/1953::67.04425792521647::He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.
OptoBotics1310::576::427::15/3/1939::33.821566482992594::I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope.
OptoBotics1311::140::123::5/6/1812::7.73957250965478::"I am beginning to understand," said the little prince. "There is a flower... I think that she has tamed me..."
OptoBotics1312::629::169::15/6/1936::45.660037073336625::"Men," said the little prince, "set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round..."
OptoBotics1313::21::16::6/12/1995::53.83046063724506::"Three and two make five. Five and seven make twelve. Twelve and three make fifteen. Good morning. Fifteen and seven make twenty-two. Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight. I haven't time to light it again. Twenty-six and five make thirty-one. Phew! Then that makes five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one."
OptoBotics1314::631::38::21/12/1866::33.77039921117784::And, na&#239;vely, she showed her four thorns. Then she added:
OptoBotics1315::112::77::18/5/1836::48.49296334403791::"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"
OptoBotics1316::299::121::11/3/1977::29.089309998611334::And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!
OptoBotics1317::568::41::14/1/1928::76.21987832493625::And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said:
OptoBotics1318::249::186::18/3/1913::50.29743344445132::"Then  the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!"
OptoBotics1319::829::32::8/11/1823::31.077653915806223::"Sire," he said to him, "I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question  "
OptoBotics1320::922::814::15/1/2012::47.06006858308466::The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:
OptoBotics1321::963::176::3/4/1939::0.795723831480688::"I cannot play with you," the fox said. "I am not tamed."
OptoBotics1322::669::620::20/4/1855::4.564242004637286::I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall  and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.
OptoBotics1323::248::97::7/4/1937::2.163196337375506::The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions  but when one flushes does that not mean "Yes"?
OptoBotics1324::304::228::1/9/1902::34.78399377055295::He breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again:
OptoBotics1325::199::73::21/6/1835::7.90368409569594::"Not even the locomotive engineer knows that," said the switchman.
OptoBotics1326::867::460::21/1/1992::24.10172215124946::Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.
OptoBotics1327::816::737::9/8/1923::29.106056052981632::For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.
OptoBotics1328::694::393::19/7/1928::63.43491658940472::In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.
OptoBotics1329::827::816::2/4/1804::75.69749809738168::"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me..."
OptoBotics1330::155::1::16/12/1912::39.9422943120272::"Why are you drinking?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics1331::809::110::24/8/1847::88.39388074725602::"I have nothing more to do here," he said to the king. "So I shall set out on my way again."
OptoBotics1332::720::37::15/2/1849::46.48578787963428::The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colors with the greatest care. She dressed herself slowly. She adjusted her petals one by one.
OptoBotics1333::683::626::25/12/1867::97.84914628481806::You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the "other planets." I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.
OptoBotics1334::866::415::1/3/1946::95.78672700979929::"Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!" he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming. For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.
OptoBotics1335::158::68::1/4/1968::96.5845627994134::"I am thirsty for this water," said the little prince. "Give me some of it to drink..."
OptoBotics1336::623::55::15/10/2011::64.95848699808013::"That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?"
OptoBotics1337::437::370::15/11/1989::77.3556317921756::For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower.
OptoBotics1338::158::3::20/7/1974::63.17820756136733::"Where are the men?" the little prince at last took up the conversation again. "It is a little lonely in the desert..."
OptoBotics1339::680::435::19/7/1894::56.73272204631981::"I tell you  it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you. Snakes  they are malicious creatures. This one might bite you just for fun..."
OptoBotics1340::26::13::17/1/1997::11.309814583423227::"Because they save a tremendous amount of time," said the merchant. "Computations have been made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week."
OptoBotics1341::633::592::11/12/1899::28.747311651363017::And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.
OptoBotics1342::362::1::19/4/1943::66.86713814892812::I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"
OptoBotics1343::197::63::23/1/1810::61.11546905772217::"Good morning," the little prince said to him. "Your cigarette has gone out."
OptoBotics1344::972::566::6/4/1981::90.42907516136475::The fourth planet belonged to a businessman. This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince's arrival.
OptoBotics1345::847::301::24/5/1891::58.54266185672492::Perhaps you will ask me, "Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?" The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.
OptoBotics1346::585::124::24/12/1938::91.67846266042048::I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little.
OptoBotics1347::3::1::13/6/1918::14.811544620432226::"I should like to see a sunset... Do me that kindness... Order the sun to set..."
OptoBotics1348::329::275::22/1/1947::55.58380679248209::"But extinct volcanoes may come to life again," the little prince interrupted. "What does that mean  'ephemeral'?"
OptoBotics1349::139::50::17/10/1923::78.15445226234209::"The grown-ups are very strange," the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics1350::628::20::4/10/1938::40.268472597798485::The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head:
OptoBotics1351::679::154::24/9/1840::13.889294019233988::The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber. She chose her colors with the greatest care. She dressed herself slowly. She adjusted her petals one by one.
OptoBotics1352::998::678::3/5/1936::17.22609421940683::"If I ordered a general," he would say, by way of example, "if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault."
OptoBotics1353::440::337::10/3/1833::73.87270074533966::ce at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men.
OptoBotics1354::654::235::10/2/1874::62.98080547327096::"It is an act too often neglected," said the fox. "It means to establish ties."
OptoBotics1355::759::460::13/3/1814::0.44035223513235744::ce at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men.
OptoBotics1356::348::243::12/2/1836::67.92460404534995::"Good evening," said the little prince courteously.
OptoBotics1357::913::66::3/11/1886::86.15720653954354::He was afraid, there was no doubt about that. But he laughed lightly.
OptoBotics1358::484::27::6/5/1810::22.711407239450754::He could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing.
OptoBotics1359::263::16::11/10/1831::69.12636643725925::"Men," said the little prince, "set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round..."
OptoBotics1360::171::16::15/10/1911::61.158911824380816::He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses.
OptoBotics1361::908::85::11/9/1867::38.50956596588515::"It is a question of discipline," the little prince said to me later on. "When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work," the little prince added, "but very easy."
OptoBotics1362::221::210::19/8/1832::92.36339529454057::"I am looking for men," said the little prince. "What does that mean  'tame'?"
OptoBotics1363::294::30::25/12/1835::11.641823536471962::As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower  the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..." And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...
OptoBotics1364::913::463::21/2/1987::27.740007441608316::The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little. He had already traveled so much and so far!
OptoBotics1365::791::269::14/4/1856::47.185670379019044::The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:
OptoBotics1366::868::257::23/2/1832::16.503262966641465::"And what do you do with five-hundred millions of stars?"
OptoBotics1367::526::351::14/5/1947::33.453240207678746::When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter.
OptoBotics1368::56::52::16/10/1962::72.71353784069964::And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me:
OptoBotics1369::236::190::19/11/1868::97.36283556741841::"Are they pursuing the first travelers?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics1370::476::356::13/8/2011::61.435184261050914::I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone's rifle...
OptoBotics1371::761::113::17/10/1911::39.4773159643925::"I shall look as if I were suffering. I shall look a little as if I were dying. It is like that. Do not come to see that. It is not worth the trouble..."
OptoBotics1372::103::63::14/1/1892::82.26964465724768::"Approach, so that I may see you better," said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.
OptoBotics1373::700::645::1/1/2017::15.009571250427278::"May I sit down?" came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.
OptoBotics1374::224::117::3/11/1991::39.99182480662282::I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radianceof the gifts I received.
OptoBotics1375::283::173::3/6/2010::77.24343625541675::I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenienanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.
OptoBotics1376::517::119::11/5/1883::76.87240944399801::And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious:
OptoBotics1377::493::69::19/6/1866::54.42620803709074::"I know some one," said the little prince, "who would make a bad explorer."
OptoBotics1378::872::719::18/2/1826::33.50839886701931::"Sire," he said to him, "I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question  "
OptoBotics1379::612::490::9/2/1948::30.54834836819067::He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness.
OptoBotics1380::201::131::18/5/1864::52.33123411272699::"It is possible," said the fox. "On the Earth one sees all sorts of things."
OptoBotics1381::934::142::15/4/1980::25.931486568724836::"As for me," said the little prince to himself, "if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water."
OptoBotics1382::548::266::14/1/1884::66.1736040082577::When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince's last words came reeling back into my memory:
OptoBotics1383::718::218::17/4/2012::43.67695370736154::"Ah, then," the king said. "I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order."
OptoBotics1384::872::613::14/12/1808::73.35626098153615::"What is essential is invisible to the eye," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
OptoBotics1385::673::522::10/2/2000::27.34391334223857::The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man.
OptoBotics1386::701::70::4/1/1864::88.42791960236627::And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly. He cried out, then:
OptoBotics1387::848::613::23/7/1933::28.955307333306646::There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:
OptoBotics1388::392::28::19/1/2007::41.74144903055079::"I order you to ask me a question," the king hastened to assure him.
OptoBotics1389::173::122::20/1/1824::53.23599810453818::"If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed," he said, "he should be able to give me a reasonable order. He should be able, for example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute. It seems to me that conditions are favorable..."
OptoBotics1390::305::217::23/12/1967::56.400524016990786::"Hum! Hum!" said the king. "I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. Thus his life will depend on your justice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily. He is the only one we have."
OptoBotics1391::677::373::2/10/1975::95.89817586378568::"I know some one," said the little prince, "who would make a bad explorer."
OptoBotics1392::695::118::22/11/1864::26.617286363825855::I replied, "Yes, that is so." And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.
OptoBotics1393::953::658::5/6/1801::7.700820230435513::The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.
OptoBotics1394::226::42::7/9/1881::75.32435830950341::He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge.
OptoBotics1395::836::786::10/11/1815::91.70624499084099::But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead:
OptoBotics1396::177::41::13/9/1842::71.76323469189789::What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!
OptoBotics1397::476::380::4/4/1824::96.09002692312369::But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:
OptoBotics1398::175::20::12/4/1960::34.4245225290213::Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France. If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like...
OptoBotics1399::147::46::21/7/1824::73.38765840003538::For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures...
OptoBotics1400::221::212::23/3/1851::68.48327292916836::"I administer them," replied the businessman. "I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence."
OptoBotics1401::249::71::2/11/1855::44.044657185195646::"I am beginning to understand," said the little prince. "There is a flower... I think that she has tamed me..."
OptoBotics1402::512::151::24/12/1831::89.20272980681189::"You mix everything up together... You confuse everything..."
OptoBotics1403::100::17::23/10/1882::11.491198026389293::It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply.
OptoBotics1404::458::361::19/5/1996::72.67351041411474::"Why are you selling those?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1405::35::18::18/3/1988::43.85439886255781::But at another time I say to myself: "At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night..." And then the little bells are changed to tears...
OptoBotics1406::845::530::21/11/1824::74.8672379822249::The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky.
OptoBotics1407::613::586::24/11/1828::41.73619671075161::I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand.
OptoBotics1408::982::806::11/8/1852::82.24141660413635::"Geographies," said the geographer, "are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write of eternal things."
OptoBotics1409::426::379::21/1/1898::43.86276001474382::"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little."
OptoBotics1410::778::576::14/11/1859::25.88939799923863::So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. "Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!" My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger fme.
OptoBotics1411::493::126::9/9/1997::5.708373907097386::He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330. He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge.
OptoBotics1412::257::179::6/5/2010::39.542179385176446::At one time I say to myself: "Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully..." Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.
OptoBotics1413::232::18::20/5/2018::97.41932691134521::"I wonder," he said, "whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again... Look at my planet. It is right there above us. But how far away it is!"
OptoBotics1414::43::22::14/7/1836::97.50142668151334::"Oh, look! Here is an explorer!" he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming.
OptoBotics1415::231::35::12/6/1964::93.73969291152345::But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a na&#239;ve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.
OptoBotics1416::894::78::21/9/1858::68.99507496123563::"You are not fair, little prince," I said. "I don't know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside."
OptoBotics1417::387::358::13/5/1997::44.50631510899722::And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious:
OptoBotics1418::702::286::20/11/2018::56.94124951181577::"But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart..."
OptoBotics1419::814::452::6/10/2018::34.03740889860697::For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.
OptoBotics1420::974::169::9/9/1824::74.23076892793418::It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right,
OptoBotics1421::333::156::8/7/2011::6.433060633773346::I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:
OptoBotics1422::74::20::18/9/1916::28.871183273412193::"It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true..."
OptoBotics1423::225::20::14/5/1864::92.67451449233118::And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower. So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity  which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:
OptoBotics1424::424::63::25/4/1987::14.107391680601044::The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there, 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men  that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups. To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lam
OptoBotics1425::894::818::9/9/1817::74.9952802499426::This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly  as if seized by a grave doubt  "It is true, isn't it, that sheep eat little bushes?"
OptoBotics1426::13::9::20/10/1893::87.080925854682::"It is entertaining," thought the little prince. "It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence."
OptoBotics1427::835::201::7/9/1920::99.02200299502044::"What must I do, to tame you?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1428::37::3::23/7/1954::20.288865100631803::"One only understands the things that one tames," said the fox. "Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me..."
OptoBotics1429::67::2::3/8/2016::74.91303051951162::"That frightens me... I cannot, any more..." murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.
OptoBotics1430::729::446::11/6/1955::57.98410953576262::"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little."
OptoBotics1431::209::144::6/7/1851::14.704466367136904::The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement.
OptoBotics1432::66::37::18/1/1925::27.106202053043894::And he too said nothing more, because he was crying...
OptoBotics1433::792::274::6/8/1881::71.39314628844492::But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch.
OptoBotics1434::951::659::19/4/1938::86.31631971890566::"Hum! Hum!" replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac. "Hum! Hum! That will be about  about  that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed!"
OptoBotics1435::165::109::22/1/1872::45.512312484999285::The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anyt
OptoBotics1436::426::57::24/9/1842::33.19656033052153::"Clap your hands, one against the other," the conceited man now directed him.
OptoBotics1437::321::250::3/7/1804::20.550472768976423::When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince's last words came reeling back into my memory:
OptoBotics1438::229::223::19/10/2019::9.207857415549936::As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower  the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..." And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...
OptoBotics1439::321::1::25/7/1923::65.38430623234169::"These are not the same ones," said the switchman. "It is an exchange."
OptoBotics1440::132::77::25/5/1819::40.65137585153836::Perhaps you will ask me, "Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?" The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.
OptoBotics1441::124::32::3/7/1860::9.656204122303558::"Are they pursuing the first travelers?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics1442::461::395::2/1/2007::18.920525097847595::And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower. So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity  which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince:
OptoBotics1443::200::72::22/11/1900::59.17838578980674::"Exactly," the geographer said. "But I am not an explorer. I haven't a single explorer on my planet. It is not the geographer who goes out to che receives the explorers in his study. He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer's moral character."
OptoBotics1444::220::161::18/9/1983::11.027145428897466::"If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my flower is there...' But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened... And you think that is not important!"
OptoBotics1445::226::174::20/7/1912::19.697780446233672::"I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence!' And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man  he is a mushroom!"
OptoBotics1446::815::609::22/7/1999::32.76564067945309::The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower. It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all.
OptoBotics1447::738::202::8/11/1936::8.980595675525771::"Men," said the little prince, "set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round..."
OptoBotics1448::539::331::5/9/1905::37.39422186273905::"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me..."
OptoBotics1449::274::226::2/6/2007::19.860930579990598::"Men?" she echoed. "I think there are six or seven of them in existence. I saw them, several years ago. But one never knows where to find them. The wind blows them away. They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult."
OptoBotics1450::46::13::5/6/1869::18.821093034948987::"What planet is this on which I have come down?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1451::340::298::17/6/1966::81.24203536115162::But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch.
OptoBotics1452::968::317::4/10/1926::17.450100012258407::Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.
OptoBotics1453::216::29::1/6/1852::7.606551978055565::"Good morning  Good morning  Good morning," answered the echo.
OptoBotics1454::11::8::10/9/1950::39.41005819656377::The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.
OptoBotics1455::778::78::3/6/1875::83.01380066223956::I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radianceof the gifts I received.
OptoBotics1456::369::306::9/10/1986::93.45125827317311::"It has done me good," said the fox, "because of the color of the wheat fields." And then he added:
OptoBotics1457::359::37::1/4/1965::66.110779700256::That night I did not see him set out on his way. He got away from me without making a sound. When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step. He said to me merely:
OptoBotics1458::798::633::24/3/1996::15.659663482123431::"I am right here," the voice said, "under the apple tree."
OptoBotics1459::65::17::1/8/1857::59.49721408838244::But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets  such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus  to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, "Asteroid 325".
OptoBotics1460::610::32::23/5/1872::38.60316459912::"Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer. So would an explorer who drank too much."
OptoBotics1461::405::387::14/9/2005::95.09760709824641::In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."
OptoBotics1462::21::1::8/2/1941::53.46810395034479::And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden!
OptoBotics1463::895::220::1/8/1942::79.83261093363349::"The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will  "
OptoBotics1464::7::0::16/2/1848::87.43653503657575::"We would have to put them one on top of the other," he said.
OptoBotics1465::533::99::1/8/1866::88.27437753550392::And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious:
OptoBotics1466::544::374::10/5/1989::50.01354111318002::"You are not at all like my rose," he said. "As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world."
OptoBotics1467::651::173::23/10/1904::55.78876811164943::But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:
OptoBotics1468::311::49::9/8/1971::11.757529824647882::"It is entertaining," thought the little prince. "It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence."
OptoBotics1469::372::226::22/10/2013::6.276293016743873::But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a na&#239;ve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.
OptoBotics1470::414::291::14/3/1870::52.770916862149186::That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly:
OptoBotics1471::637::279::13/8/1967::56.323178278577444::"Millions of those little objects," he said, "which one sometimes sees in the sky."
OptoBotics1472::85::83::17/4/1872::96.9130724771275::"The orders are that I put out my lamp. Good evening."
OptoBotics1473::204::132::22/3/1991::78.05274288858043::"That is very interesting," said the little prince. "Here at last is a man who has a real profession!" And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen.
OptoBotics1474::847::103::17/4/1972::28.790388747813523::"Oh, but this is not on the Earth!" said the little prince.
OptoBotics1475::827::730::18/10/1983::42.97113694354145::"Geographies," said the geographer, "are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters. We write of eternal things."
OptoBotics1476::851::169::4/9/1891::48.40962684289233::But the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people never hear anything but praise.
OptoBotics1477::339::82::19/9/1857::43.223857582152355::For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.
OptoBotics1478::907::221::22/2/1976::22.363615868770857::"You are not fair, little prince," I said. "I don't know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside."
OptoBotics1479::578::344::1/2/1966::47.23859732116218::The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement.
OptoBotics1480::746::720::8/6/1954::48.11920584548417::I realized clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him... His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.
OptoBotics1481::401::156::16/6/1982::81.50284540456755::"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away..."
OptoBotics1482::23::22::9/6/1921::37.687750288022315::"It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh..."
OptoBotics1483::200::102::11/4/1889::95.78736843605114::His face turned from white to red as he continued:
OptoBotics1484::222::118::18/6/1971::29.913877173733894::"You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns."
OptoBotics1485::853::481::5/3/1998::83.58032537986585::I was only twenty meters from the wall, and I still saw nothing.
OptoBotics1486::500::70::1/4/2019::36.37327874002939::And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman's cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder.
OptoBotics1487::758::400::19/8/1851::31.931938884282328::"What must I do, to tame you?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1488::832::124::2/8/1997::17.17978897007123::"You are beautiful, but you are empty," he went on. "One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you  the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she tha
OptoBotics1489::37::16::25/5/1976::98.01088743663941::"What is essential is invisible to the eye," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
OptoBotics1490::745::657::5/3/1991::83.67581990217153::I did not want him to tire himself with the rope.
OptoBotics1491::640::2::18/4/1875::13.043919217433043::Then he went on with his reflections: "I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees  and one of them perhaps extinct forever... That doesn't make me a very great prince..."
OptoBotics1492::89::38::17/6/1969::45.687711240242834::So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.
OptoBotics1493::116::53::18/10/1945::52.57881308696343::"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen."
OptoBotics1494::30::24::11/11/2011::83.14827736880662::"Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk  and the day will last as long as you like."
OptoBotics1495::133::1::8/9/1974::6.277219488199092::"Just that," said the fox. "To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world..."
OptoBotics1496::908::213::25/6/1856::99.32230393441971::"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."
OptoBotics1497::609::359::7/3/2003::22.48024156217976::"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible..."
OptoBotics1498::166::161::19/6/1882::60.000883839722384::"She would be very much annoyed," he said to himself, "if she should see that... She would cough most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life  for if I did not do that, to humble myself also, she would really allow herself to die..."
OptoBotics1499::328::118::21/3/1994::13.723107665097945::"It means, 'which is in danger of speedy disappearance.'"
OptoBotics1500::356::271::15/1/1844::85.78189071481074::On matters of consequence, the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grown-ups.
OptoBotics1501::449::230::13/7/1866::56.95942602549135::"Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening..."
OptoBotics1502::443::307::23/11/1922::52.25986289059988::"There is nothing to understand," said the lamplighter. "Orders are orders. Good morning."
OptoBotics1503::50::19::2/12/1950::57.23981491626661::"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."
OptoBotics1504::611::385::10/7/1824::95.93472354091105::"Men," said the fox. "They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?"
OptoBotics1505::324::208::3/1/1907::73.9188853442195::When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:
OptoBotics1506::550::491::1/2/1981::26.432164782330002::"This man," the little prince said to himself, "reasons a little like my poor tippler..."
OptoBotics1507::981::581::19/9/1829::38.659519656692154::Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.
OptoBotics1508::354::298::7/4/1934::16.645426172388223::When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth. I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters. And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it. Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they co
OptoBotics1509::468::391::24/12/1842::58.87912192137681::"I know some one," said the little prince, "who would make a bad explorer."
OptoBotics1510::245::105::6/5/1838::20.999759986702436::"You must keep your promise," said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.
OptoBotics1511::496::340::8/10/1864::43.94365579515267::The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question.
OptoBotics1512::792::79::5/5/1980::20.65119080901142::The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.
OptoBotics1513::310::78::24/4/1954::96.14418065110131::So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn.
OptoBotics1514::451::410::1/11/1982::67.08709918216702::"Yes?" said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about.
OptoBotics1515::800::333::8/10/1957::24.410356939420396::"But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells..."

OptoBotics1521::668::577::8/5/1932::18.08907812752747::"Good morning," the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.
OptoBotics1522::521::438::23/9/1894::32.640660888320504::"Come and play with me," proposed the little prince. "I am so unhappy."
OptoBotics1523::752::420::9/4/1973::64.51263978860466::The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books.
OptoBotics1524::306::174::12/4/2014::43.83867167815498::"I think it is time for breakfast," she added an instant later. "If you would have the kindness to think of my needs..."
OptoBotics1525::706::590::24/7/1903::70.3074288692264::"You mix everything up together... You confuse everything..."
OptoBotics1526::888::366::12/9/1938::57.85684418476866::"I wonder," he said, "whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again... Look at my planet. It is right there above us. But how far away it is!"
OptoBotics1527::79::45::12/7/2010::69.0905016100011::"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important."
OptoBotics1528::355::90::6/10/1969::45.47632741077056::"That frightens me... I cannot, any more..." murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.
OptoBotics1529::143::92::8/10/1922::77.0526332397247::"Those also are actions too often neglected," said the fox. "They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the vineyards. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all."
OptoBotics1530::532::431::17/3/1852::95.51817781918413::"We would have to put them one on top of the other," he said.
OptoBotics1531::346::327::6/7/1811::86.40010332930869::"May I sit down?" came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.
OptoBotics1532::426::256::16/11/1841::36.34598917723291::The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They imagine that they fill a great deal of space. They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations. They adore figures, and that will please them. But do not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I know, confidence in me.
OptoBotics1533::715::689::12/1/1838::73.01450237810748::I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart...
OptoBotics1534::905::66::14/12/1986::97.6010700865678::And, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil. One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.
OptoBotics1535::220::184::14/10/1989::24.877596303461193::"Then you shall judge yourself," the king answered. "that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom."
OptoBotics1536::489::132::23/12/2014::81.3060208755588::"What place would you advise me to visit now?" he asked.

OptoBotics1540::979::743::20/8/1867::42.28865406989779::If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, "What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?" Instead, they demand: "How old is he? How many brothers has he? Hey have learned anything about him.
OptoBotics1541::356::311::24/12/1860::91.11315708386412::"You know  my descent to the earth... Tomorrow will be its anniversary."

OptoBotics1543::707::135::18/1/1932::32.248134536416885::Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing abou
OptoBotics1544::363::51::14/3/2007::59.34999405053184::Just so, you might say to them: "The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists." And what good would it do to tell them that? They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: "The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612," then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.
OptoBotics1545::410::113::21/9/1855::40.72747589746895::I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little.

OptoBotics1551::809::688::2/11/1934::21.906862269686954::"What is that big book?" said the little prince. "What are you doing?"

OptoBotics1555::539::240::8/10/1933::60.41166326948022::"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king," the monarch said to him. "I forbid you to do so."
OptoBotics1556::537::484::25/5/1827::68.15165080458401::"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."
OptoBotics1557::132::55::13/8/2006::24.82835956376008::The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars.
OptoBotics1558::248::9::4/7/1975::51.32001862609381::er glass globe, he realized that he was very close to tears.
OptoBotics1559::332::284::10/3/1919::20.671704119104817::"What is that big book?" said the little prince. "What are you doing?"
OptoBotics1560::219::23::15/3/2002::97.96568724192916::And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams...
OptoBotics1561::408::406::18/3/1985::24.69649004190504::"I am right here," the voice said, "under the apple tree."
OptoBotics1562::144::26::3/11/1885::94.4108084076056::"Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged..."
OptoBotics1563::766::258::7/12/1921::21.84380577637861::"Are they pursuing the first travelers?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics1564::172::116::17/7/1989::76.85554036909856::At one time I say to myself: "Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully..." Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.
OptoBotics1565::589::230::8/5/1876::30.51332278932496::Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same. So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.
OptoBotics1566::864::237::8/6/1979::85.3313053716861::What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!
OptoBotics1567::804::304::17/2/1935::56.209967195159514::"What a queer planet!" he thought. "It is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether harsh and forbidding. And the people have no imagination. They repeat whatever one says to them... On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak..."
OptoBotics1568::619::98::9/6/2019::44.71295034227898::And now six years have already gone by... I have never yet told this story. The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive. I was sad, but I told them: "I am tired."
OptoBotics1569::269::159::18/9/1895::7.2424769392151145::But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch.
OptoBotics1570::420::37::25/9/1868::20.582468895182494::"You know  a muzzle for my sheep... I am responsible for this flower..."
OptoBotics1571::285::34::25/12/2000::21.903104837988874::"Where are the men?" the little prince asked, politely.
OptoBotics1572::309::223::20/10/1901::49.91682624045597::"I know some one," said the little prince, "who would make a bad explorer."
OptoBotics1573::591::344::25/1/1908::4.33997188511891::But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:
OptoBotics1574::153::138::1/2/1839::58.87487980465266::"And the orders have been changed since that time?"
OptoBotics1575::334::255::6/5/1886::71.0049390643399::"Were they not satisfied where they were?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1576::510::222::22/7/1932::74.92600008212037::"I have your sheep. And I have the sheep's box. And I have the muzzle..."
OptoBotics1577::998::902::25/6/1830::0.057341082114037434::I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radianceof the gifts I received.
OptoBotics1578::371::299::14/4/1981::37.818998852336115::"No," said the little prince. "I am looking for friends. What does that mean  'tame'?"
OptoBotics1579::735::494::1/7/2015::95.6746787280982::On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.
OptoBotics1580::179::101::18/11/1870::35.88878744244403::"Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform," the king went on. "Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable."
OptoBotics1581::160::143::11/3/1932::58.06688192097829::"Are they pursuing the first travelers?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics1582::219::77::19/5/1895::12.925660769398196::"I am not at all afraid of tigers," she went on, "but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?"
OptoBotics1583::712::563::18/2/1863::82.24367566857391::"Good morning. Why have you just put out your lamp?"
OptoBotics1584::630::350::7/3/2006::78.92667836533579::The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there, 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men  that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups. To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lam
OptoBotics1585::372::118::7/1/1940::74.91192909683046::"I am all alone  all alone  all alone," answered the echo.
OptoBotics1586::668::574::15/2/1905::76.84811969699334::He still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move.
OptoBotics1587::178::155::3/7/1889::39.44416491796072::"Why are you selling those?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1588::69::39::25/7/1915::98.5736775112688::"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?"
OptoBotics1589::911::673::6/10/1956::19.43725752662968::"I know some one," said the little prince, "who would make a bad explorer."
OptoBotics1590::14::3::22/1/1927::81.42318800155634::Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole  only these two would live free from toil and care: they would be busy twice a year.
OptoBotics1591::615::245::21/6/1816::80.52073290116954::The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question.
OptoBotics1592::470::339::21/4/1837::83.36046029388024::And he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying.
OptoBotics1593::948::288::16/10/2013::2.8775256869801757::But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:
OptoBotics1594::239::162::6/9/1925::12.110044810780296::"Men," said the fox. "They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?"
OptoBotics1595::900::888::10/6/1947::31.495411536544626::"The grown-ups are certainly very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics1596::211::206::4/7/1836::1.5569746533304563::"Are they coming back already?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics1597::317::293::3/2/2016::32.27857512411805::His face turned from white to red as he continued:
OptoBotics1598::359::112::2/6/1935::9.911929897806138::The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky.
OptoBotics1599::873::745::20/10/1889::13.3793043109544::Perhaps you will ask me, "Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?" The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.
OptoBotics1600::519::248::10/1/1931::78.06403777371904::"It is beautiful," the snake said. "What has brought you here?"
OptoBotics1601::967::11::18/4/1826::53.3004381619226::But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:
OptoBotics1602::897::893::25/3/2019::61.85081316818124::"Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged..."
OptoBotics1603::48::47::8/5/1943::70.0594908324917::I was only twenty meters from the wall, and I still saw nothing.
OptoBotics1604::353::14::19/10/1853::98.0816655999018::He was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort:
OptoBotics1605::494::133::13/11/1991::81.68261988681354::As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: "What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower  the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep..." And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...
OptoBotics1606::85::59::11/5/1960::38.132322504593596::"I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep."
OptoBotics1607::288::36::19/6/1946::99.04792366088593::"You move me to pity  you are so weak on this Earth made of granite," the snake said. "I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet. I can  "
OptoBotics1608::784::249::10/8/1985::51.32354790674396::"This is more entertaining than the visit to the king," the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other. The conceited man again raised his hat in salute.
OptoBotics1609::373::224::18/6/1802::74.44698300576566::"What makes the desert beautiful," said the little prince, "is that somewhere it hides a well..."
OptoBotics1610::477::289::22/12/1811::75.34511133632323::"Do you hear?" said the little prince. "We have wakened the well, and it is singing..."
OptoBotics1611::941::468::13/1/1823::38.13680640187316::"The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything! I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me. I ought never to have run away from her... I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little stratagems. Flowers are so inconsistent! But I was too young to know how to love her "
OptoBotics1612::113::68::23/4/1821::7.538789418703962::"Little man," I said, "I want to hear you laugh again."
OptoBotics1613::953::940::16/6/1893::16.36690870124574::"The orders have not been changed," said the lamplighter. "That is the tragedy! From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed!"
OptoBotics1614::240::59::8/6/1829::64.59455111334883::And now six years have already gone by... I have never yet told this story. The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive. I was sad, but I told them: "I am tired."
OptoBotics1615::832::741::22/10/1952::86.07925865552767::"Good morning," the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.
OptoBotics1616::942::610::11/6/1825::16.14670348572198::"Hum! Hum!" replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac. "Hum! Hum! That will be about  about  that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed!"
OptoBotics1617::902::507::13/12/1801::41.8165674465786::The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.
OptoBotics1618::77::13::23/7/1972::12.093908347429549::But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:
OptoBotics1619::255::96::13/12/1882::98.62014677958933::"You know," he said, "I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to..."
OptoBotics1620::159::94::24/9/1817::83.56499254291437::I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking.
OptoBotics1621::282::194::11/12/1945::63.74883789897977::"Ah," I said to the little prince, "these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!"
OptoBotics1622::390::74::24/2/1850::3.3317566250541497::"Oh, but this is not on the Earth!" said the little prince.
OptoBotics1623::403::2::12/9/1984::78.02105871051202::"This man," the little prince said to himself, "reasons a little like my poor tippler..."
OptoBotics1624::463::281::21/1/1954::34.74971459453601::"The planet Earth," replied the geographer. "It has a good reputation."
OptoBotics1625::830::817::18/10/1908::11.91254335484092::"You are beautiful, but you are empty," he went on. "One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you  the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she tha
OptoBotics1626::376::263::3/6/1964::8.083346688195792::"I myself own a flower," he continued his conversation with the businessman, "which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is extinct; one never knows). It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them. But you are of no use to the stars..."
OptoBotics1627::21::3::12/9/1986::66.50992399944187::He breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again:
OptoBotics1628::853::400::3/6/1903::60.06939438064249::In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."
OptoBotics1629::783::477::7/5/1905::63.90340887584042::I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenienanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.
OptoBotics1630::502::485::14/3/2013::7.843333141900355::"I order you to ask me a question," the king hastened to assure him.
OptoBotics1631::300::170::16/1/1943::28.36154634831033::"We would have to put them one on top of the other," he said.
OptoBotics1632::916::681::7/5/1929::4.752035666433563::"The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare bet!"
OptoBotics1633::935::450::23/1/1812::27.152037856877385::The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books.
OptoBotics1634::866::427::14/3/2000::34.61049762134915::"Are they coming back already?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics1635::207::108::9/11/1952::43.95030026451958::"Dear little man," I said to him, "you are afraid..."
OptoBotics1636::840::830::5/5/2014::88.62614070283776::"Oh! I understand you very well," said the little prince. "But why do you always speak in riddles?"
OptoBotics1637::55::1::18/4/1975::71.4263632059807::Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:
OptoBotics1638::104::74::9/10/1975::82.51878456108766::But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets  such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus  to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, "Asteroid 325".
OptoBotics1639::616::195::10/7/1825::35.501682315886974::"Because where I live everything is very small..."
OptoBotics1640::693::266::6/8/1901::56.45397970556098::And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me:
OptoBotics1641::534::214::4/6/1973::99.93751629184348::"It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true..."
OptoBotics1642::534::215::11/10/1987::40.850090328501906::That was his first moment of regret. But he took courage once more.
OptoBotics1643::476::164::9/12/2005::50.78034479802872::"I have your sheep. And I have the sheep's box. And I have the muzzle..."
OptoBotics1644::785::113::12/4/1801::39.26849982249786::"What are you doing there?" he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.
OptoBotics1645::982::282::11/10/1948::66.16666837750272::I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:
OptoBotics1646::418::312::8/1/2010::70.84768950845022::For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time. The little prince went on with his explanation:
OptoBotics1647::747::475::18/8/1930::87.78632595090713::Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance. And this time everybody accepted his report.
OptoBotics1648::469::250::18/12/1995::19.943859388317907::"I am not at all afraid of tigers," she went on, "but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?"
OptoBotics1649::66::58::5/4/1912::18.334732089041694::"That is strictly correct," I said. "But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?"
OptoBotics1650::985::806::3/7/1883::66.77113121983159::But he did not answer me. He said to me, instead:
OptoBotics1651::356::348::17/6/1984::13.229863324010472::"And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found. It is better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for you. And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens... they will all be your friends. And, besides, I am going to make you a present..."
OptoBotics1652::883::409::17/3/1922::18.587064885749694::"The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen..."
OptoBotics1653::724::226::14/10/2011::31.936727841469025::And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly. He cried out, then:
OptoBotics1654::10::5::25/12/2006::11.999619744355549::Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same. So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.
OptoBotics1655::935::180::7/9/1890::4.23391451926941::"You do not live here," said the fox. "What is it that you are looking for?"
OptoBotics1656::124::37::15/10/1942::0.0686532487501057::In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.
OptoBotics1657::80::43::18/9/1865::7.599709149880718::"Were they not satisfied where they were?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1658::99::63::22/12/1913::85.34851470351263::"I am not at all afraid of tigers," she went on, "but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?"
OptoBotics1659::278::243::18/1/1864::54.75818595949011::"You know  a muzzle for my sheep... I am responsible for this flower..."
OptoBotics1660::795::120::18/1/1843::42.30780294347267::"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen."
OptoBotics1661::142::54::21/2/1983::58.45174126783126::On the fifth day  again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep  the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded:
OptoBotics1662::63::25::23/4/1940::64.90935538548825::The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anyt
OptoBotics1663::459::105::11/10/1935::63.935769336180506::"Ah," I said to the little prince, "these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!"
OptoBotics1664::735::45::14/4/1923::77.29117123465613::"Then you shall judge yourself," the king answered. "that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom."
OptoBotics1665::436::341::12/6/1909::25.800410013186536::"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me..."
OptoBotics1666::357::303::18/7/1906::52.96020565019064::"In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night... You  only you  will have stars that can laugh!"
OptoBotics1667::963::584::23/8/1975::47.999364369504804::"I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
OptoBotics1668::454::99::19/7/1874::24.411741044227696::For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower.
OptoBotics1669::305::111::12/9/1894::93.68363567830582::"Hum! Hum!" said the king. "I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will condemn him to death. Thus his life will depend on your justice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily. He is the only one we have."
OptoBotics1670::773::753::4/8/1821::21.173403421823668::If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters. They never say to you, "What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?" Instead, they demand: "How old is he? How many brothers has he? Hey have learned anything about him.
OptoBotics1671::471::314::9/9/2001::6.728934226201899::He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air. He did not understand this quiet sweetness.
OptoBotics1672::466::36::12/8/1982::37.321733945183766::"It may well be that this man is absurd. But he is not so absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler. For at least his work has some meaning. When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower. When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep. That is a beautiful occupation. And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful."
OptoBotics1673::10::3::6/4/1863::11.18488495350476::And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously. Then he added:
OptoBotics1674::120::37::7/12/1909::65.99784288287711::I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart...
OptoBotics1675::841::789::23/4/1933::9.219556700455833::I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.
OptoBotics1676::79::43::7/1/1806::48.03785624802477::Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole  only these two would live free from toil and care: they would be busy twice a year.
OptoBotics1677::602::493::13/12/1807::99.84586938426587::But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:
OptoBotics1678::671::624::23/11/1883::35.33534498291344::The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:
OptoBotics1679::867::584::7/11/1904::85.07621272390082::"That is strictly correct," I said. "But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?"
OptoBotics1680::205::9::5/6/1946::30.533194316725766::"We do not record them," said the geographer, "because they are ephemeral."
OptoBotics1681::34::20::14/10/1945::66.89699762696844::"Oh, but this is not on the Earth!" said the little prince.
OptoBotics1682::502::274::22/11/1905::98.08921838239219::"You have plans that I do not know about," I said.
OptoBotics1683::223::141::24/6/1872::83.48088048755429::He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses.
OptoBotics1684::280::148::8/10/1884::40.38376355867634::"I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep."
OptoBotics1685::722::3::5/6/2000::96.02761758914427::And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!
OptoBotics1686::718::195::2/12/1929::68.20150030905681::"Five-hundred-and-one million what?" repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it.
OptoBotics1687::702::4::3/7/1946::79.0074185290553::"Do not go," said the king, who was very proud of having a subject. "Do not go. I will make you a Minister!"
OptoBotics1688::793::559::8/10/1970::57.78754072536733::"I order you to do so," the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle.
OptoBotics1689::279::9::3/2/2014::29.846852249169288::For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures...
OptoBotics1690::605::570::13/2/1849::32.30961707429066::"If I owned a silk scarf," he said, "I could put it around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me. But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven..."
OptoBotics1691::21::10::19/2/1990::98.46737773274546::"This man," the little prince said to himself, "reasons a little like my poor tippler..."
OptoBotics1692::898::670::7/7/1985::53.46424111077779::As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.
OptoBotics1693::658::340::21/5/1845::86.04548146980025::"I have nothing more to do here," he said to the king. "So I shall set out on my way again."
OptoBotics1694::67::14::3/9/1891::65.05994325850249::After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game's monotony.
OptoBotics1695::445::333::16/10/1872::57.291890801052745::"The desert is beautiful," the little prince added.
OptoBotics1696::158::39::14/1/1912::63.61123045162705::"The planet Earth," replied the geographer. "It has a good reputation."
OptoBotics1697::401::350::2/7/1938::8.67534061857822::"Oh, no!" I cried. "No, no, no! I don't believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head. Don't you see  I am very busy with matters of consequence!"
OptoBotics1698::23::21::14/9/1934::3.8653904955854412::"You know, it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink..."
OptoBotics1699::593::131::10/1/1837::98.59997965422909::But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles.
OptoBotics1700::177::103::22/8/1858::77.42526433819226::"Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform," the king went on. "Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable."
OptoBotics1701::457::61::24/11/1954::73.21349642764733::"Not so small that  Look! He has gone to sleep..."
OptoBotics1702::232::50::3/11/1897::66.04741791071838::"Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?"
OptoBotics1703::521::19::4/7/1844::5.084315015079344::"Ah! Here is a subject," exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming.
OptoBotics1704::316::85::22/9/1823::35.54583958824315::"Men?" she echoed. "I think there are six or seven of them in existence. I saw them, several years ago. But one never knows where to find them. The wind blows them away. They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult."
OptoBotics1705::477::30::1/4/1801::92.91985691292902::He still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move.
OptoBotics1706::136::29::6/8/1885::22.467518739180413::"Little man," I said, "tell me that it is only a bad dream  this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star..."
OptoBotics1707::336::254::14/1/2004::40.996029270306735::Now my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say  not entirely. But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak. It was not such a heavy body... and at night I love to listen to the stars. It is like five hundred million little bells...
OptoBotics1708::369::276::22/5/1815::17.744711689438663::"So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?"
OptoBotics1709::840::84::25/6/1800::82.19383764936487::"I want to, very much," the little prince replied. "But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand."
OptoBotics1710::632::603::7/5/1971::65.22770070841433::I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:
OptoBotics1711::613::350::11/7/1994::27.39974881795002::"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."
OptoBotics1712::693::382::7/3/1838::92.98204936859011::I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand.
OptoBotics1713::621::373::20/10/1823::89.18423108263347::"Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear that laughter!"
OptoBotics1714::121::100::4/6/1958::25.64342771767819::"You are not fair, little prince," I said. "I don't know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside."
OptoBotics1715::716::355::11/1/1828::36.56136599003054::For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time. The little prince went on with his explanation:
OptoBotics1716::369::196::4/6/1950::3.691075082620321::"No. That would be too complicated. But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs. For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it."
OptoBotics1717::967::5::5/8/1816::21.117430114042502::When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter.
OptoBotics1718::698::586::9/4/1986::56.82591828458563::"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane."
OptoBotics1719::40::25::8/12/1811::41.36189825999579::"Then you shall judge yourself," the king answered. "that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others. If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom."
OptoBotics1720::672::166::22/2/1907::4.300376903819481::"We would have to put them one on top of the other," he said.
OptoBotics1721::942::684::16/10/1867::86.62362895493602::And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously. Then he added:
OptoBotics1722::191::83::11/5/1920::60.17681544657923::"This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time."
OptoBotics1723::597::581::17/10/1974::79.82630514773365::"You do not live here," said the fox. "What is it that you are looking for?"
OptoBotics1724::601::138::12/2/1891::52.13806558076038::And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!
OptoBotics1725::882::588::17/8/1966::62.29687364214023::"You do not live here," said the fox. "What is it that you are looking for?"
OptoBotics1726::465::76::6/2/1868::58.91272854719581::When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand.
OptoBotics1727::414::137::19/10/2014::51.77648676949095::And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!
OptoBotics1728::958::341::20/8/1940::5.324470969250495::But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead:
OptoBotics1729::876::192::8/11/1915::35.13457817217489::"That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water..."
OptoBotics1730::720::399::11/6/1951::61.36502744517174::I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very clab.
OptoBotics1731::935::56::19/10/1843::51.91080827252276::"My flower is ephemeral," the little prince said to himself, "and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!"
OptoBotics1732::807::16::12/1/1973::0.3899726296658135::"I administer them," replied the businessman. "I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence."
OptoBotics1733::273::12::7/1/1829::81.38704965391163::"And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found. It is better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for you. And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens... they will all be your friends. And, besides, I am going to make you a present..."
OptoBotics1734::794::442::20/1/1816::10.909526867729246::"During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I have been disturbed only three times. The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where. He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition. The second time, eleven years ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism. I don't get enough exercise. I have no time for loafing. The third time  well, this is it! I was sa
OptoBotics1735::655::603::20/6/2000::64.9991594490922::"Forget that I am ashamed," the tippler confessed, hanging his head.
OptoBotics1736::746::46::3/11/1997::54.905790725627504::I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking.
OptoBotics1737::330::326::5/9/1835::75.532073534756::The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They imagine that they fill a great deal of space. They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations. They adore figures, and that will please them. But do not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I know, confidence in me.
OptoBotics1738::573::152::1/5/1994::44.02624545713534::"But you  you come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!"
OptoBotics1739::406::361::16/3/1807::67.99940587567762::"Approach, so that I may see you better," said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.
OptoBotics1740::712::46::6/8/1914::86.6027984996387::"I wonder," he said, "whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again... Look at my planet. It is right there above us. But how far away it is!"
OptoBotics1741::837::281::17/9/1800::26.0084076907247::Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has  yes or no?  eaten a rose...
OptoBotics1742::616::235::2/8/1956::81.79555894400438::"Not even the locomotive engineer knows that," said the switchman.
OptoBotics1743::243::169::2/4/1816::14.360009811583774::"I order you to do so," the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle.
OptoBotics1744::162::33::23/3/1982::5.169122200353737::"But extinct volcanoes may come to life again," the little prince interrupted. "What does that mean  'ephemeral'?"
OptoBotics1745::65::57::18/9/1922::87.96377886007173::"There is nothing to understand," said the lamplighter. "Orders are orders. Good morning."
OptoBotics1746::50::24::7/1/1921::17.702808556773796::This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.
OptoBotics1747::717::101::23/12/1893::37.48483561373717::At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly:
OptoBotics1748::798::568::2/1/1869::38.99339784253616::"What is essential is invisible to the eye," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
OptoBotics1749::468::33::1/5/1941::21.714417149792077::"Then you don't remember. This is not the exact spot."
OptoBotics1750::474::52::11/8/1964::49.586282208429054::But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets  such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus  to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, "Asteroid 325".
OptoBotics1751::428::5::24/2/1813::30.68634449269205::"The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will  "
OptoBotics1752::428::298::14/5/1900::48.40353973119631::The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement.
OptoBotics1753::491::306::23/12/1959::19.977970631998677::"Good morning  Good morning  Good morning," answered the echo.
OptoBotics1754::352::338::4/4/2003::83.1053762422712::At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:
OptoBotics1755::421::39::9/6/1990::40.068707383760746::"Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you  a week ago  you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place where you landed?"
OptoBotics1756::377::37::9/12/1879::9.51134985523574::"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."
OptoBotics1757::374::292::8/12/1947::7.3025044930650544::"It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music. You remember  how good it was."
OptoBotics1758::119::90::22/5/1975::5.611726739395162::"I have your sheep. And I have the sheep's box. And I have the muzzle..."
OptoBotics1759::824::574::11/4/2013::61.6068766964211::"Exactly. One must require from each one the duty which each one can perform," the king went on. "Accepted authority rests first of all on reason. If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable."
OptoBotics1760::185::65::24/5/1970::41.61448614762925::"I am glad," he said, "that you agree with my fox."
OptoBotics1761::792::626::7/6/1853::91.22062086328498::But he did not answer me. He said to me, instead:
OptoBotics1762::696::693::11/10/1856::47.363404064758306::"Oh, but this is not on the Earth!" said the little prince.
OptoBotics1763::944::899::22/1/1808::92.02433548809597::"And what should one do to make the hat come down?" he asked.
OptoBotics1764::726::442::24/4/1959::87.31635771653701::"That frightens me... I cannot, any more..." murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.
OptoBotics1765::513::487::11/12/1987::99.12630305803046::"The grown-ups are very strange," the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics1766::140::54::13/12/1991::9.29274336131366::"Your baobabs  they look a little like cabbages."
OptoBotics1767::842::713::8/3/1998::38.0824731531103::But I was not reassured. I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed...
OptoBotics1768::745::338::3/8/1983::14.938811977865996::"But you  you come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!"
OptoBotics1769::47::15::23/6/1944::43.58627345205313::"The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep. I will draw you a railing to put around your flower. I will  "
OptoBotics1770::810::212::1/7/1935::84.02811120015689::"I can carry you farther than any ship could take you," said the snake.
OptoBotics1771::297::211::22/7/1930::75.98930973048633::"The planet Earth," replied the geographer. "It has a good reputation."
OptoBotics1772::750::228::15/8/1989::7.065823393138104::The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.
OptoBotics1773::34::9::20/10/1845::63.67522313489401::So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.
OptoBotics1774::266::172::14/8/1833::95.15994645765322::I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:
OptoBotics1775::702::376::17/1/1829::12.796704962230965::So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near
OptoBotics1776::530::162::13/10/1907::30.578513661930838::I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radianceof the gifts I received.
OptoBotics1777::445::360::7/12/1987::38.4829337357138::The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.
OptoBotics1778::727::619::9/1/1843::73.44237919793319::"As for me," said the little prince to himself, "if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water."
OptoBotics1779::126::35::7/5/1854::0.028362410697102547::I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order. He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes. He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenienanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions. Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.
OptoBotics1780::244::14::16/11/1996::50.49747752056507::But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch.
OptoBotics1781::874::325::15/11/1875::61.887252834350946::He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me:
OptoBotics1782::499::450::25/1/1866::56.23831511501485::"Ashamed of what?" insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.
OptoBotics1783::646::583::12/4/1990::37.99368578467038::"The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house."
OptoBotics1784::76::56::2/7/1858::23.888927719723608::"She would be very much annoyed," he said to himself, "if she should see that... She would cough most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life  for if I did not do that, to humble myself also, she would really allow herself to die..."
OptoBotics1785::352::149::22/8/1984::13.702031504154977::"That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend. But his planet is indeed too small. There is no room on it for two people..."
OptoBotics1786::358::78::6/12/1967::47.18138134394725::"The grown-ups are very strange," the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics1787::503::358::8/11/1834::57.44372383616212::"I have been having some trouble with a flower," said the little prince.
OptoBotics1788::679::33::6/12/1811::46.147831011349794::The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.
OptoBotics1789::514::134::8/8/1840::95.90921007389582::"The grown-ups are certainly very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics1790::843::159::8/1/2011::10.908742051120191::"Sire," he said to him, "I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question  "
OptoBotics1791::52::44::15/3/1814::53.67793254840897::"Five hundred million what?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1792::470::303::21/6/1944::76.98593906611964::As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with a sigh, he took his leave.
OptoBotics1793::286::42::14/11/1976::88.49951858866412::"It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are discovered."
OptoBotics1794::214::211::6/7/1985::45.98459845930396::The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement.
OptoBotics1795::894::403::10/9/1960::61.961261521792196::The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.
OptoBotics1796::237::126::2/9/1925::82.71958470750515::"The grown-ups are very strange," the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics1797::312::124::10/7/1978::17.35956334484::I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart...
OptoBotics1798::726::40::16/7/1925::43.654925100264265::And, na&#239;vely, she showed her four thorns. Then she added:
OptoBotics1799::716::9::1/11/1810::44.99879046232643::"Eh? Are you still there? Five-hundred-and-one million  I can't stop... I have so much to do! I am concerned with matters of consequence. I don't amuse myself with balderdash. Two and five make seven..."
OptoBotics1800::142::94::3/10/1931::18.118078526780135::The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter. I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anyt
OptoBotics1801::92::36::16/9/1944::14.704052959800007::"You know  one loves the sunset, when one is so sad..."
OptoBotics1802::696::690::9/12/1841::77.39301428767465::"This is the Earth; this is Africa," the snake answered.
OptoBotics1803::278::123::11/4/2004::22.77738969771812::"Ah!" The little prince was disappointed. "Has it any mountains?"
OptoBotics1804::490::333::18/5/1812::62.79385823757308::"Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer. So would an explorer who drank too much."
OptoBotics1805::570::477::4/5/1996::6.130747955181404::At one time I say to myself: "Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully..." Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.
OptoBotics1806::340::108::23/12/1916::34.93247594347025::The little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset. And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored.
OptoBotics1807::522::92::10/5/1918::28.515931512139037::"It is beautiful," the snake said. "What has brought you here?"
OptoBotics1808::533::433::4/4/1980::96.7323047983134::"What planet is this on which I have come down?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1809::188::16::11/12/1849::60.285914286856965::"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to." But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:
OptoBotics1810::148::106::17/12/1947::55.11725322276124::"I have your sheep. And I have the sheep's box. And I have the muzzle..."
OptoBotics1811::802::771::2/2/1942::43.965998942510176::And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously. Then he added:
OptoBotics1812::259::210::24/8/1996::41.11034643205813::"It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music. You remember  how good it was."
OptoBotics1813::36::12::13/2/2016::59.246728797848455::"If I ordered a general," he would say, by way of example, "if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault."
OptoBotics1814::355::198::11/6/2000::97.48681865821031::"I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.
OptoBotics1815::807::96::6/1/1884::48.5899470350746::But I was not reassured. I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed...
OptoBotics1816::125::48::21/1/1866::78.86109772132023::But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a na&#239;ve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.
OptoBotics1817::970::957::7/11/1825::13.444489658449832::I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand.
OptoBotics1818::407::181::18/9/1842::82.03735749841378::Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling. And I heard him say:
OptoBotics1819::950::288::8/8/1829::11.671446066884117::"You know  a muzzle for my sheep... I am responsible for this flower..."
OptoBotics1820::276::56::4/12/1805::74.8536668930916::The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.
OptoBotics1821::389::197::13/3/1905::90.34755017495976::The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest  but how moving  and exciting  she was!
OptoBotics1822::161::127::14/10/1845::45.317961595011894::"I have nothing more to do here," he said to the king. "So I shall set out on my way again."
OptoBotics1823::999::730::9/5/2018::87.17497728070217::"I ought not to have listened to her," he confided to me one day. "One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance. Mine perfumed all my planet. But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace. This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity."
OptoBotics1824::842::830::17/9/1879::71.67420258524858::But there is one extraordinary thing... when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower...
OptoBotics1825::857::402::20/12/1919::24.680213303458764::"But now you are going to cry!" said the little prince. 
OptoBotics1826::86::27::7/7/1835::62.52596313949569::The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.
OptoBotics1827::893::878::22/2/1822::89.50945039955596::And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:
OptoBotics1828::47::4::6/6/1985::26.745708436293047::"What are you doing there?" he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.
OptoBotics1829::513::152::18/10/1889::43.29939074804508::er glass globe, he realized that he was very close to tears.
OptoBotics1830::473::247::14/10/1852::63.79950509384524::I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them. But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"
OptoBotics1831::365::114::7/12/2000::87.30026356863483::"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen."
OptoBotics1832::859::67::7/6/1916::30.83024293174098::"Hum! Hum!" replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac. "Hum! Hum! That will be about  about  that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed!"
OptoBotics1833::452::59::17/8/1913::23.39929387062021::"My friend the fox  " the little prince said to me.
OptoBotics1834::80::41::6/11/1906::79.09078346402794::"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen."
OptoBotics1835::713::404::1/6/1947::65.44232994136026::"And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?"
OptoBotics1836::856::4::21/11/1889::25.531486851447895::"Where do you come from?" the old gentleman said to him.
OptoBotics1837::613::129::8/1/1938::21.360127634678317::When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:
OptoBotics1838::923::205::15/1/1914::81.10941172308046::Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.
OptoBotics1839::402::174::21/1/1999::46.00070638124391::"It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away..."
OptoBotics1840::246::174::7/11/1925::38.96889076004453::He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.
OptoBotics1841::399::332::14/5/1980::13.186838436508507::"No," said the little prince. "I am looking for friends. What does that mean  'tame'?"
OptoBotics1842::714::225::1/8/1867::25.258726937349085::"The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen..."
OptoBotics1843::46::21::12/3/1889::20.633408919955276::"That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery."
OptoBotics1844::689::512::25/8/1844::9.804822755539854::"Good evening," said the little prince courteously.
OptoBotics1845::980::631::6/2/1824::16.3302729865323::"The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary," he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics1846::12::11::23/12/1851::78.79454919476326::"It is beautiful," the snake said. "What has brought you here?"
OptoBotics1847::887::28::11/9/1818::64.17832417468297::The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.
OptoBotics1848::33::14::1/9/1928::34.007647260906616::His face turned from white to red as he continued:
OptoBotics1849::794::295::13/1/1938::7.339086359755909::So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. "Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!" My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger fme.
OptoBotics1850::729::663::9/4/1957::96.14624624026949::"Good evening," said the little prince courteously.
OptoBotics1851::654::384::23/1/1825::57.22080749643684::"Five hundred million what?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1852::125::10::23/8/1876::8.356249601601585::"It is much farther... It is much more difficult..."
OptoBotics1853::819::624::1/7/1819::87.65473574632932::"Good morning," the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.
OptoBotics1854::495::211::15/12/1863::60.22841236550958::"It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers..."
OptoBotics1855::767::506::19/3/1823::86.26642257102613::"If I ordered a general," he would say, by way of example, "if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault."
OptoBotics1856::135::16::22/2/2012::34.846576203844116::"I," replied the little prince, "do not like to condemn anyone to death. And now I think I will go on my way."
OptoBotics1857::646::391::17/8/1972::88.45138193474577::I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.
OptoBotics1858::486::447::11/11/1863::24.756036001228466::The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.
OptoBotics1859::338::67::1/9/1951::34.72497074298219::"Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?"
OptoBotics1860::309::169::14/9/1819::83.83869751059444::"The planet Earth," replied the geographer. "It has a good reputation."
OptoBotics1861::735::0::2/9/1944::61.67126919338245::"Oh, no. Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming. As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence. There is no time for idle dreaming in my life."
OptoBotics1862::8::0::4/11/2015::62.37645956951263::"No," said the little prince. "I am looking for friends. What does that mean  'tame'?"
OptoBotics1863::666::580::15/8/1974::52.43470925276837::"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."
OptoBotics1864::555::218::8/11/1924::62.57297023229989::"Where do you come from?" the old gentleman said to him.
OptoBotics1865::797::292::2/1/1876::32.900438983196146::"Men have forgotten this truth," said the fox. "But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose..."
OptoBotics1866::121::67::19/7/1882::34.196300429607675::"But extinct volcanoes may come to life again," the little prince interrupted. "What does that mean  'ephemeral'?"
OptoBotics1867::690::191::25/6/1977::98.35420759848957::"We do not know that," the king said to him. "I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom. I am very old. There is no room here for a carriage. And it tires me to walk."
OptoBotics1868::29::18::13/12/1825::18.700486443852206::"Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged..."
OptoBotics1869::38::23::9/6/1964::3.0181438737105326::"A sheep  if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too?"
OptoBotics1870::553::528::15/1/1861::27.96277777704824::"I am all alone  all alone  all alone," answered the echo.
OptoBotics1871::226::59::19/8/1892::87.95248212360055::"What are you doing there?" he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.
OptoBotics1872::806::238::10/7/1883::54.26032295724664::I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.
OptoBotics1873::430::424::15/9/1944::15.499262272675196::"The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd," he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.
OptoBotics1874::992::189::5/11/1891::30.639234145476422::"Are they pursuing the first travelers?" demanded the little prince.
OptoBotics1875::504::477::8/10/1865::43.85204383242951::And one day he said to me: "You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes," he added, "there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes..."
OptoBotics1876::864::789::21/9/1873::74.45062875062764::"Oh, look! Here is an explorer!" he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming.
OptoBotics1877::879::655::1/8/1981::61.76882560784337::"Ah! Ah! I am about to receive a visit from an admirer!" he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming. For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.
OptoBotics1878::304::4::14/5/1857::55.154263213114284::The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars.
OptoBotics1879::241::210::7/10/1855::23.033691568840343::Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:
OptoBotics1880::407::102::24/7/1953::80.12791752389151::"The men where you live," said the little prince, "raise five thousand roses in the same garden  and they do not find in it what they are looking for."
OptoBotics1881::559::62::7/4/1917::44.28939562709686::"It is not funny at all!" said the lamplighter. "While we have been talking together a month has gone by."
OptoBotics1882::897::317::25/7/2010::46.5496131023591::ce at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men.
OptoBotics1883::75::70::20/5/1974::42.358707219618466::The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice. It said:
OptoBotics1884::50::16::5/3/1936::42.792181806618615::ce at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men.
OptoBotics1885::873::13::7/10/1945::21.37640910958393::"What place would you advise me to visit now?" he asked.
OptoBotics1886::123::70::17/12/1881::36.5379845779591::"Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the place."
OptoBotics1887::603::481::21/12/2003::55.68979333154811::"Five-hundred-and-one million what?" repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it.
OptoBotics1888::158::44::10/11/1850::10.438745671683957::"That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key."
OptoBotics1889::347::60::13/4/2015::85.69161509905123::He was afraid, there was no doubt about that. But he laughed lightly.
OptoBotics1890::512::261::17/6/1836::46.53756665012811::The little prince clapped his hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.
OptoBotics1891::910::95::10/6/1993::10.875006282611954::"It is entertaining," thought the little prince. "It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence."
OptoBotics1892::934::448::20/5/1959::1.0421148797372326::"You see yourself," he said, "that this is not a sheep. This is a ram. It has horns."
OptoBotics1893::522::96::3/1/1815::86.46293197811774::The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars.
OptoBotics1894::505::308::20/4/1927::21.662335507511678::"That frightens me... I cannot, any more..." murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.
OptoBotics1895::855::401::23/3/1809::56.66480132997472::"Ah! Here is a subject," exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming.
OptoBotics1896::950::888::8/2/1815::35.470378844101965::"Good evening," said the little prince courteously.
OptoBotics1897::699::682::3/4/1913::66.39074912960011::"Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged..."
OptoBotics1898::543::18::25/2/1992::79.20082242342104::"That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane."
OptoBotics1899::46::0::4/8/1940::25.841720071943286::"Then you don't remember. This is not the exact spot."
OptoBotics1900::196::17::3/1/1861::58.61354281214034::The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.
OptoBotics1901::24::3::22/7/1819::25.852872121083504::The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.
OptoBotics1902::266::66::9/10/2002::1.1408369314354516::"Don't linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!"
OptoBotics1903::359::0::23/8/1811::19.183860845811253::And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.
OptoBotics1904::687::171::17/3/1963::78.47128486286555::"If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed," he said, "he should be able to give me a reasonable order. He should be able, for example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute. It seems to me that conditions are favorable..."
OptoBotics1905::95::34::4/3/2007::86.74723978275584::"But I am more powerful than the finger of a king," said the snake.
OptoBotics1906::785::699::8/11/1981::81.72508068728327::"What does this mean?" I demanded. "Why are you talking with snakes?"
OptoBotics1907::980::177::21/3/1842::25.10943821648083::But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles.
OptoBotics1908::90::84::13/11/1984::25.679245792948123::That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly:
OptoBotics1909::208::65::15/8/1873::4.808569937475782::"What a queer planet!" he thought. "It is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether harsh and forbidding. And the people have no imagination. They repeat whatever one says to them... On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak..."
OptoBotics1910::917::875::24/3/1866::15.383585346205297::er glass globe, he realized that he was very close to tears.
OptoBotics1911::339::219::24/9/1960::19.286012395205056::"It would have been better to come back at the same hour," said the fox. "If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you... One must observe the proper rites..."
OptoBotics1912::40::14::8/4/1833::51.418430067932476::"I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep."
OptoBotics1913::44::28::22/8/1875::84.9571160121633::"Oh, no!" I cried. "No, no, no! I don't believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head. Don't you see  I am very busy with matters of consequence!"
OptoBotics1914::379::139::12/7/2019::14.620519064128768::"Leave it to me," I said. "It is too heavy for you."
OptoBotics1915::506::488::19/3/1800::46.40223701505699::"If I ordered a general," he would say, by way of example, "if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault."
OptoBotics1916::192::157::23/4/1952::80.53655746638103::On the fifth day  again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep  the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded:
OptoBotics1917::687::143::18/11/1997::89.26544930141284::Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France. If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like...
OptoBotics1918::245::210::25/9/1852::98.74198300274128::"The men where you live," said the little prince, "raise five thousand roses in the same garden  and they do not find in it what they are looking for."
OptoBotics1919::515::239::22/9/1905::2.0880206695368386::"Only the children know what they are looking for," said the little prince. "They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry..."
OptoBotics1920::979::670::4/6/1982::21.13721488490591::"No. This sheep is already very sickly. Make me another."
OptoBotics1921::252::205::2/12/1946::62.39356131530115::"But now you are going to cry!" said the little prince. 
OptoBotics1922::483::273::7/5/1855::32.72624028260792::And one day he said to me: "You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes," he added, "there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes..."
OptoBotics1923::287::220::4/12/1959::9.859328056471062::"I know some one," said the little prince, "who would make a bad explorer."
OptoBotics1924::799::206::5/2/1849::54.32305531946966::"That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small!"
OptoBotics1925::111::32::17/10/1834::40.54772920239008::"All men have the stars," he answered, "but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems. For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent. You  you alone  will have the stars as no one else has them  "
OptoBotics1926::539::273::14/4/1943::83.03826646875372::"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies  and the caterpillars  who will call upon me? You will be far away... As for the large animals  I am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws."
OptoBotics1927::895::718::1/10/2017::70.46850668666174::"You are not very powerful. You haven't even any feet. You cannot even travel..."
OptoBotics1928::880::738::19/9/1999::46.54156997572869::As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with a sigh, he took his leave.
OptoBotics1929::431::410::17/8/1861::10.735498652265807::"Clap your hands, one against the other," the conceited man now directed him.
OptoBotics1930::758::553::7/2/1851::29.25149225970085::"But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart..."
OptoBotics1931::896::186::5/9/2016::93.62312438715952::"Ashamed of drinking!" The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence.
OptoBotics1932::918::135::14/2/1995::73.23020281404034::Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it:
OptoBotics1933::844::754::22/3/1889::56.365889900093414::"But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells..."
OptoBotics1934::543::448::1/10/1919::31.080866408610298::He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me:
OptoBotics1935::82::2::21/5/1998::44.86365573604569::When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand.
OptoBotics1936::523::457::14/1/1932::68.63265068436702::"Little man," I said, "tell me that it is only a bad dream  this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star..."
OptoBotics1937::609::149::7/2/1840::94.54220861415315::"The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare bet!"
OptoBotics1938::710::170::9/1/1874::14.262193925073063::But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:
OptoBotics1939::22::2::12/1/1853::79.61685107982223::"Five hundred million what?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1940::916::234::3/1/1965::56.73546968990727::And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious:
OptoBotics1941::370::261::24/2/2012::30.022445224280258::This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.
OptoBotics1942::232::193::4/3/1864::35.977137684174345::"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."
OptoBotics1943::355::315::13/8/2019::2.8968888331382447::I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall  and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.
OptoBotics1944::531::66::7/4/1921::53.985299591425495::"Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer. So would an explorer who drank too much."
OptoBotics1945::723::130::23/8/1803::61.39750452906865::"If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed," he said, "he should be able to give me a reasonable order. He should be able, for example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute. It seems to me that conditions are favorable..."
OptoBotics1946::726::447::4/11/1880::59.30440888986772::Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling. And I heard him say:
OptoBotics1947::932::216::5/9/2007::81.54197183078387::"Little man," I said, "tell me that it is only a bad dream  this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star..."
OptoBotics1948::864::731::21/3/1880::20.834732422229596::"I administer them," replied the businessman. "I count them and recount them. It is difficult. But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence."
OptoBotics1949::449::405::23/1/1940::70.24242933677964::"I don't believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are na&#239;ve. They reassure themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons..."
OptoBotics1950::857::193::19/7/1917::8.357042121317537::"That is very interesting," said the little prince. "Here at last is a man who has a real profession!" And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen.
OptoBotics1951::744::361::6/3/1974::87.71087617504355::"You know  a muzzle for my sheep... I am responsible for this flower..."
OptoBotics1952::248::207::16/10/1868::73.6290904351216::"Do you really admire me very much?" he demanded of the little prince.
OptoBotics1953::358::205::25/3/2019::11.251062943909796::"What makes the desert beautiful," said the little prince, "is that somewhere it hides a well..."
OptoBotics1954::909::806::24/8/1816::25.29335455607725::It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.
OptoBotics1955::394::267::9/9/2012::98.83615375984331::At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:
OptoBotics1956::665::649::6/9/1824::88.76036577318447::"It is strange," I said to the little prince. "Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope..." He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.
OptoBotics1957::433::70::19/1/1814::83.69391350750006::"Five hundred million what?" asked the little prince.
OptoBotics1958::721::90::24/5/1848::5.871687370922196::And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.
OptoBotics1959::244::49::24/5/1871::38.24364337931354::What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets!
OptoBotics1960::558::485::11/11/1971::55.19921347217435::There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:
OptoBotics1961::514::443::20/7/1969::96.87658102913275::"It is a question of discipline," the little prince said to me later on. "When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work," the little prince added, "but very easy."
OptoBotics1962::405::244::10/1/1880::61.42132497948265::I realized clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him... His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.
OptoBotics1963::873::598::10/12/1943::81.77673930413357::The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little. He had already traveled so much and so far!
OptoBotics1964::114::21::11/10/1986::75.54614052462588::My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:
OptoBotics1965::891::347::4/6/1989::68.40271498692285::"The men where you live," said the little prince, "raise five thousand roses in the same garden  and they do not find in it what they are looking for."
OptoBotics1966::9::7::20/10/1951::58.851484726233885::I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very clab.
OptoBotics1967::920::671::9/5/1924::79.66483173033035::Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.
OptoBotics1968::826::71::14/3/1873::94.87870895664497::"A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts."
OptoBotics1969::988::983::12/11/1954::61.869434158679304::"There will surely be enough grass for him," I said. "It is a very small sheep that I have given you."
OptoBotics1970::996::696::25/11/1828::46.90938402826189::Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it:
OptoBotics1971::302::235::3/6/1828::84.14850074186401::The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.
OptoBotics1972::560::115::24/9/1905::35.98284738830513::"That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key."
OptoBotics1973::116::16::5/12/1809::25.57813048694061::"The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen..."
OptoBotics1974::89::2::6/6/1923::36.00076905953661::On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said.
OptoBotics1975::422::203::5/9/1999::37.44814415722155::"Don't linger like this. You have decided to go away. Now go!"
OptoBotics1976::321::273::1/11/2007::13.032476720239616::"You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favorable."
OptoBotics1977::340::205::10/1/1821::40.37566953901812::"Where do you come from?" the old gentleman said to him.
OptoBotics1978::855::616::17/8/1843::49.264327452615575::"At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live. In the place I came from  "
OptoBotics1979::856::198::4/5/2014::67.95159867443736::"The men where you live," said the little prince, "raise five thousand roses in the same garden  and they do not find in it what they are looking for."
OptoBotics1980::897::545::14/11/1867::88.12961808856203::"And the orders have been changed since that time?"
OptoBotics1981::22::10::24/6/1868::75.76365848610392::"It is a hat for salutes," the conceited man replied. "It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way."
OptoBotics1982::51::11::13/1/1808::96.0759695638393::"I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now."
OptoBotics1983::870::123::15/8/1801::16.626264812129378::"Yes, a month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening."
OptoBotics1984::692::119::24/2/1999::58.53920571922882::The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:
OptoBotics1985::257::237::18/5/1908::27.128034124448106::"You move me to pity  you are so weak on this Earth made of granite," the snake said. "I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet. I can  "
OptoBotics1986::559::200::20/4/1915::33.516524550139195::"Forget that I am ashamed," the tippler confessed, hanging his head.
OptoBotics1987::103::25::11/1/1884::3.984965600028345::"It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers..."
OptoBotics1988::442::198::2/10/1815::69.82674465975532::"Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you  a week ago  you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place where you landed?"
OptoBotics1989::820::687::14/9/1988::96.71094474703133::"You must be very patient," replied the fox. "First you will sit down at a little distance from me  like that  in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day..."
OptoBotics1990::90::76::6/9/1920::27.875425498639995::So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve. "Children," I say plainly, "watch out for the baobabs!" My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger fme.
OptoBotics1991::704::624::20/5/1879::70.68780700440077::"And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?"
OptoBotics1992::667::112::4/3/1866::19.74390366324138::I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: "If this bolt still won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer." Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts:
OptoBotics1993::294::181::25/4/1821::98.17624393720025::"You are not at all like my rose," he said. "As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world."
OptoBotics1994::304::289::24/3/1862::73.18337442367928::And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.
OptoBotics1995::92::51::5/12/1868::22.399035585734772::He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly...
OptoBotics1996::548::469::7/9/1892::63.258104519762796::"That is very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here where you live!"
OptoBotics1997::957::706::3/11/1916::77.90261267760782::The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there, 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men  that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups. To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lam
OptoBotics1998::490::33::6/9/1969::31.384141047888292::"Ah, then," the king said. "I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning. Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity. Come, now! Yawn again! It is an order."
OptoBotics1999::98::51::14/9/1885::8.267648652894156::Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:
