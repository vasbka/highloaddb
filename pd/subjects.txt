Making::0::Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume.

International::0::"It is a question of discipline," the little prince said to me later on. "When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care.

Work::1::And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.::1946-04-21::9.706262121829745
Early::1::I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking.::1846-02-12::45.370894063966794

Work::1::The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:::1862-06-20::17.336772191389972
Youth::1::Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same. So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.::1958-04-16::66.746338835016

Psychology::1::"If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars.

Nursing::1::"Now go away," said the little prince. "I want to get down from the wall."::1915-01-01::26.402270445778807
Engineering::1::In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.::1949-11-05::58.03760948635139

Administration::1::So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.::1820-10-10::62.39813558784692

Tourism::1::I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone's rifle...::1889-07-23::70.72876919874551

Pathology::1::"One only understands the things that one tames," said the fox. "Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops.

Sports::1::"She would be very much annoyed," he said to himself, "if she should see that... She would cough most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at.

Tourism::1::Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region.

Criminology::1::"You must be very patient," replied the fox. "First you will sit down at a little distance from me  like that  in the grass.

Mental::1::But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets  such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus  to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, "Asteroid 325".::1924-08-21::75.42680477101128

South::1::"Of course I love you," the flower said to him. "It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance. But you  you have been just as foolish as I. Try to be happy... Let the glass globe be. I don't want it any more."::1985-01-08::21.797986764264333
Management::1::"That frightens me... I cannot, any more..." murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.::1915-09-02::85.66099427733114
Education::1::Oh, little prince! Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life... For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:::1923-12-07::48.614482050004156
Psychology::1::"Now go away," said the little prince. "I want to get down from the wall."::1800-05-04::66.21557746240423
Geography::1::The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.::1904-03-12::89.71140974268627

Development::1::Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:::1957-09-11::9.230763726093038
Management::1::"I am looking for men," said the little prince. "What does that mean  'tame'?"::1950-11-20::2.8530613184031606

Civil::1::"It is strange," I said to the little prince. "Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope..." He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.::1874-08-06::71.90037559747647
Journalism::1::So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine. And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.::1944-03-05::60.7240802807774

Statistics::1::"You are beautiful, but you are empty," he went on. "One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you  the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she tha::1919-09-14::45.4468135238168

Media::1::"Where are the men?" the little prince at last took up the conversation again. "It is a little lonely in the desert..."::1814-11-20::27.168772773308614
Sociology::1::"If I ordered a general," he would say, by way of example, "if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault."::1882-11-24::78.48145902993916
Social::1::"Good morning," the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.::1812-06-13::48.67592158826446

Sociology::1::"That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to." But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:::1959-08-09::82.80849031651647
French::1::And, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil. One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.::1883-09-02::59.26910466789054
relations::1::When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand.::1869-06-05::48.9701882648747
Technology::1::"Oh, but I have looked already!" said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet. On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all...::1827-03-19::36.401064011354315

Engineering::1::He answered me at once, "Oh, come, come!", as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.::1813-07-10::95.46820021441658
Writing::1::"Do you really admire me very much?" he demanded of the little prince.::1803-06-23::49.88516115323345
Fitness::1::As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.::1953-02-10::65.54820023255577
Art::1::The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.::1836-09-24::56.48488067179862
Science::1::"The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary," he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey.::1990-06-15::52.559479770392514
Mechanical::1::So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine.

Geology::1::"I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.::1981-01-19::54.8814277703535
Manufacturing and Production::1::But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets  such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus  to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, "Asteroid 325".::1820-04-03::60.099277237960166

Sciences::1::That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.::1834-12-15::4.779404277788002

Medicine::1::I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said:::2017-09-13::81.39323382445332
History::1::The fifth planet was very strange. It was the smallest of all. There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter. The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not one house. But he said to himself, nevertheless:::1920-02-24::14.370006347422892
History::1::"It is entertaining," thought the little prince. "It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence."::1847-01-10::45.32193448124529
Tourism::1::"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are very beautiful. And if not the butterflies  and the caterpillars  who will call upon me? You will be far away... As for the large animals  I am not at all afraid of any of them. I have my claws."::2018-02-17::61.99552064045345
Engineering Electronic::1::"Certainly they do," the king said. "They obey instantly. I do not permit insubordination."::1986-10-20::84.27610017584584

relations::1::In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.::1896-08-23::40.40687650757819
Astronomy::1::If you were to say to the grown-ups: "I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof," they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them: "I saw a house that cost $20,000." Then they would exclaim: "Oh, what a pretty house that is!"::1993-01-05::94.92662356102744
Communication::1::"The desert is beautiful," the little prince added.::1831-01-19::39.62534950660391
Food::1::"If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?" the king demanded. "The general, or myself?"::1975-04-18::2.3927030210360356
Design::1::The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.::1859-01-10::17.237726833078103

Recreation::1::I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radianceof the gifts I received.::1813-01-05::27.80652241182924

Art::1::I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab. The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.::1948-03-23::47.95796402196726

Technology::1::Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume.

It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.::1817-03-04::89.92235604331405
Country::1::But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed. She could not have known anything of any other worlds. Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a na&#239;ve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.::1974-05-04::60.571876396050826
Business::1::And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:::1875-02-02::84.57806438254462
Study::1::But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:::1988-01-20::74.18330046754788
Marine::1::"But you  you come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!"::1842-01-01::79.88753751876662
Information::1::"But extinct volcanoes may come to life again," the little prince interrupted. "What does that mean  'ephemeral'?"::1922-02-03::51.753784014258116
Management::1::"I don't believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are na&#239;ve. They reassure themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons..."::1961-10-11::67.3178029751819
Mathematics::1::"You must keep your promise," said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.::1848-10-22::10.854002604985158
Science::1::"It is a question of discipline," the little prince said to me later on. "When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth. It is very tedious work," the little prince added, "but very easy."::1971-02-20::97.001867132383
Anatomy::1::The little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset. And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored.::1955-01-07::86.51017843876264
Photography::1::"Do you really admire me very much?" he demanded of the little prince.::1874-09-19::45.89477976144084
Television::1::I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer.::1838-01-25::82.48985150644835
Religious::1::"Ah! I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged..."::1935-11-07::94.97684531107767
Engineering General::1::I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab. The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.::1925-09-23::51.82145743654214
History::1::"Those are the orders," replied the lamplighter. "Good morning."::1819-11-03::69.4969714144101
Professional::1::"Leave it to me," I said. "It is too heavy for you."::1807-11-08::9.488933471351913
Therapy::1::And he put out his lamp. Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares.::1854-10-20::72.15486734959462
Public::1::For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories. Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep. If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures...::1867-12-12::21.264293440560987
Engineering Telecommunications Vehicle::1::"This is the desert. There are no people in the desert. The Earth is large," said the snake.::1933-04-05::69.3897387162594
Studies::1::"Leave it to me," I said. "It is too heavy for you."::1904-01-11::31.85137556779867
Medicine::1::"Good morning," the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.::1821-04-23::87.22881802881592
Fitness::1::"During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I have been disturbed only three times. The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where. He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition. The second time, eleven years ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism. I don't get enough exercise. I have no time for loafing. The third time  well, this is it! I was sa::1938-07-20::26.718863928137516
