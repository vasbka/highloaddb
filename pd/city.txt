The soldiers were given biscuits in plenty, and they even shared them with other squadrons.::2013-06-19
Packwood::765005.7050918791::The hussar cornet Zherkov had belonged for some time to the rowdy company headed by Dolokhov in Petersburg. Abroad, Zherkov had encountered Dolokhov as a soldier, but had found it unnecessary to recognize him. Now, after Kutuzov had talked with the demoted man, he addressed him with the joy of an old friend.::1855-09-10
Wautauga Beach::414646.41319225816::On the day after the meeting of Boris and Rostov, there was a review of the Russian and Austrian troops, the fresh ones come from Russia, as well as those returned from campaigning with Kutuzov.

Harper::842192.396105113::In the front hall, Denisov, crouching on the threshold with his pipe, sat facing the sergeant major, who was reporting something. Seeing Rostov, Denisov winced and pointed over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where Telyanin was sitting, winced again, and shuddered with loathing.::1934-06-18
Telma::970115.7440012713::“The sovereign?…No, a minister…prince…ambassador…Don’t you see the feathers?…” came from the crowd. One person in the crowd, better dressed than the others, seemed to know everyone and called by name the most distinguished dignitaries of that time.::1886-09-21
New York::428250.4341490488::“Nikolenka’s leaving in a week, his…papers…are ready…he told me himself…But all the same I wouldn’t be crying” (she held up the paper she had in her hand: it was verses written by Nikolai) “…all the same I wouldn’t be crying, but you can’t…nobody can understand…what a soul he has.”::1853-01-11
Mondovi::300102.3700366835::It was past three o’clock in the afternoon when Prince Andrei, who had persuaded Kutuzov to grant his request, arrived in Grunt and went to Bagration. Bonaparte’s adjutant had not yet reached Murat’s division, and the battle had not yet begun. In Bagration’s division, nothing was known about the general course of affairs; they talked of peace, but did not believe in its possibility. They talked of battle and also did not believe in the nearness of battle.::1888-08-04
Los Angeles::824333.6832612001::“I can’t help loving the light, it’s not my fault. And I’m very happy. Do you understand me? I know you’re glad for me.”::1959-02-03

Wabash::810886.4085694569::“Don’t talk to me like that: I’m not worthy of it!” cried Natasha, and she was about to leave the room, but Pierre held her back by the hand. He knew he had something more to tell her. But when he said it, he was surprised at his words himself.::1891-01-12
Brooklyn::409075.64311074064::Bonaparte’s adjutant galloped off at full speed with this threatening letter to Murat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting his generals, moved with all his guards to the field of battle, fearing to let the ready victim slip, while Bagration’s four-thousand-man division cheerfully lit campfires, dried out, warmed up, cooked kasha for the first time in three days, and not one man in the division knew or thought about what lay ahead of him.::2019-04-14

Central Valley::207181.6985819579::From her big eyes shone rays of a kindly and timid light. These eyes lit up her whole thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her brother wanted to take the icon, but she stopped him. Andrei understood, made the sign of the cross, and kissed the icon. His face was at the same time tender (he was touched) and mocking.::2006-07-16
Lake City::945688.8927589987::“Il nous arrive du monde, mon prince,”  said Mlle Bourienne, unfolding a white napkin with her pink little hands. “Son excellence le prince Kouragine avec son fils, 224; ce que j’ai entendu dire?” *238 she said questioningly.::1801-12-08
Megler::293213.09733767534::The gray-haired valet sat dozing and listening to the prince’s snoring in the immense study. From the far side of the house, from behind a closed door, came the sounds of a Dusek sonata,45 the difficult passages repeated twenty times.::1978-09-13
Alder::694331.6657004161::They went up to the door of the sitting room, through which came the sounds of the same passage repeated again and again. Prince Andrei stopped and winced, as if expecting something unpleasant.::1973-06-11
Ronald::268739.4318448826::“Non, non, de gr226;ce…Vous 234;tes Mlle Bourienne, je vous connais d233;j224; par l’amiti233; que vous porte ma belle-soeur,”  said the princess, kissing her. “Elle ne nous attend pas!” §157::1976-04-18

Houston::391629.6736346846::Prince Vassily pondered and winced. Anna Mikhailovna understood that he feared to find in her a rival over Count Bezukhov’s will. She hastened to reassure him.::1810-02-02
Turner Corner::369186.2769070555::“You don’t understand?” the prince was shouting. “But I do! French spy! Bonaparte’s slave and spy, out of my house—out, I say!” and he slammed the door.::1807-05-11
Lofall::200771.79531119583::“Yes, stories!” Rostov began speaking loudly, glancing now at Boris, now at Bolkonsky, with eyes suddenly grown furious. “Yes, many stories are told, but our stories—the stories of those who were there, right under enemy fire—our stories have weight, not the stories of those fellows on the staff, who get rewards for doing nothing.”::1949-03-19
Kennydale::723409.7571622888::“Well, generally, talk as much as possible. Audiences are his passion; but he neither likes nor is able to talk himself, as you’ll see.”::1993-08-09
Easton::338384.39541056706::“Yes, Prince, we meet here under such sad circumstances…Well, how is our dear patient?” she said, as if oblivious of the cold, insulting gaze directed at her.::1926-10-24
Navy Yard City::767051.1303960119::“Yes, yes, I love him!” thought Natasha, rereading the letter for the twentieth time and seeking some special, deep meaning in each word.::1946-11-16
Manhattan::241442.4487067225::“I think,” the prince said, smiling, “that if they sent you instead of our dear Wintzingerode, you would take the Prussian king’s consent by storm.7 You’re so eloquent! Will you give me tea?”::1994-05-24
Phoenix::237541.19236732475::Rostov, still looking towards the fires and cries, rode with the sergeant to meet several horsemen who were riding along the line. One was on a white horse. Prince Bagration and Prince Dolgorukov, with their adjutants, had ridden out to look at the strange phenomenon of the fires and cries in the enemy army. Rostov, riding up to Bagration, reported to him and joined the adjutants, trying to hear what the generals were saying.::1999-01-03
Philadelphia::846700.2273801919::“But he, Ippolit, didn’t he tell you?” said Prince Vassily, turning to his son and seizing the princess by the hand as if she was about to run away and he had barely managed to hold her back, “didn’t he tell you how he himself, Ippolit, pined for the dear princess and how she le mettait 224; la porte? Oh! C’est la perle des femmes, princesse! ”*247 he said, turning to Princess Marya.::1824-11-10
Douglas::445210.061403872::While the couples were being placed and the musicians were tuning up, Pierre sat with his little partner. Natasha was perfectly happy: she was dancing with a grown-up  who had come from abroad.  She sat in full view of everyone and talked to him like a grown-up. In her hand was a fan which a young lady had given her to hold. And, assuming a most worldly pose (God knows where and when she had learned it), fanning herself and smiling through the fan, she talked with her partner.::1904-06-07
San Antonio::460264.86858482985::“Insolent fellows!” said the prince. “Do you know M233;tivier? I threw him out today. He was here, he was let in to see me, though I had asked them not to let anybody in,” said the prince, looking angrily at his daughter. And he recounted the whole conversation with the French doctor and the reasons why he became convinced that M233;tivier was a spy. Though those reasons were quite insufficient and unclear, no one objected.::2017-03-05
Colbert::762962.3724810075::“Yes, she’s all right. Good speed,” Nikolai replied. “If only there was a seasoned hare running through the field, I’d show you what kind of dog she is!” he thought. And turning to his groom, he said he would give a rouble to the hunter who could spot a hare in its form.::1801-04-13
Bryn Mawr::469480.81333978986::At the men’s end of the table, the conversation was becoming more and more animated. The colonel said that the manifesto with the declaration of war had already been published in Petersburg, and that a copy, which he had seen himself, had been delivered today by messenger to the commander in chief.::1878-09-02
Silverdale::562597.7544139926::“A petition—go to the officer on duty, this way, please” (he pointed him to the downstairs door). “Only you won’t be received.”::1935-08-12
Lyle::736973.732616197::“Listen, Prince,” she said, “I’ve never asked you for anything, and never will, I’ve never reminded you of my father’s friendship for you. But now, I adjure you in God’s name, do this for my son, and I will consider you my benefactor,” she added hastily. “No, don’t be angry, but promise me. I asked Golitsyn and he refused. Soyez le bon enfant que vous avez 233;t233;, ”*47 she said, trying to smile, though there were tears in her eyes.::1841-12-15
Malott::462132.0901599085::A minute later the marshal’s adjutant, M. de Castries, came in and led Balashov to the lodgings prepared for him.::1819-03-11
Bronx::684551.1334952279::The room was in semi-darkness, only two icon lamps burned before the icons, and there was a good smell of incense and flowers. The whole room was filled with small furniture: little chiffoniers, cupboards, tables. Behind a screen the white covers of a high featherbed could be seen. A little dog barked.::1871-04-15
San Diego::287737.1995458211::Princess Marya came to her father’s door that day with particular trepidation. It seemed to her not only that everyone knew her fate was to be decided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it. She read that expression on the face of Tikhon, and on the face of Prince Vassily’s valet, who met her in the corridor while carrying hot water and bowed low to her.::1976-04-10
Fairwood::626307.1808006681::Five times already, with other people, Prince Andrei had heard exactly the same phrase about the countess Zubov and the same laughter from his wife. He quietly went into the room. The princess, round, rosy, with her work in her hands, was sitting in an armchair and talking non-stop, telling over her Petersburg memories and even phrases. Prince Andrei went to her, stroked her head, and asked whether she had rested from the journey. She made a reply and went on with the same talk.::2016-02-10
Warm Beach::735249.24882905::Rostov was especially struck by the beauty of a small, purebred, red-spotted bitch in Ilagin’s pack, slender, but with muscles of steel, narrow pincers (muzzle), and prominent black eyes. He had heard about the swiftness of Ilagin’s dogs and in this beautiful bitch saw a rival to his Milka.::1859-12-08
Thomas::561110.028730925::In the winter Prince Andrei came to Bald Hills, and was cheerful, meek, and affectionate, as Princess Marya had not seen him for a long time. She sensed that something had happened to him, but he said nothing to Princess Marya about his love. Before his departure, Prince Andrei had a long talk about something with his father, and Princess Marya noticed that before his departure they were both displeased with each other.::1944-01-03
Parker::393455.71733552584::The sovereign said a few words to him and took a step towards his horse. Again the crowd of the suite and the crowd of the street, in which Rostov stood, moved towards the sovereign. Stopping by his horse and placing his hand on the saddle, the sovereign turned to the cavalry general and spoke in a loud voice, obviously wishing everyone to hear him.::1986-04-06
Steptoe::703455.8105872422::After the princess, Prince Vassily came out. Staggering, he reached the sofa on which Pierre was sitting and collapsed on it, covering his eyes with his hand. Pierre noted that he was pale and his lower jaw was twitching and shaking as in a fever.::1926-04-21
Vail::534376.0073500836::“And if I should meet His Majesty before the commander in chief, Your Excellency?” asked Rostov, holding his hand to his visor.::1947-01-05

Rosburg::820602.5041335189::“Et demandez-lui si les tirailleurs sont post233;s,”  he added. “Ce qu’ils font, ce qu’ils font!” ‡268 he said to himself, still not answering the Austrian.::1866-12-14
San Jose::24511.832728546513::“Dolokhov, Marya Ivanovna’s son,” she said in a mysterious whisper, “they say he has totally compromised her. He introduced him, invited him to his house in Petersburg, and now…She has come here, and that daredevil after her,” said Anna Mikhailovna, wishing to express her sympathy for Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half smile expressing her sympathy for the daredevil, as she called Dolokhov. “They say Pierre is totally crushed by his grief.”::1975-03-05
Onalaska::207845.22185916043::Despite the fact that in Moscow the Rostovs belonged to high society without knowing or thinking what society they belonged to, in Petersburg their society was mixed and indefinite. In Petersburg they were provincials to whom the very people that the Rostovs fed in Moscow without asking what society they belonged to would not lower themselves.::1867-10-16
Austin::686783.0915378531::“My God, my God, it’s all the same thing! Ah, where shall I go? What shall I do with myself?” And, stamping her feet, she quickly ran upstairs to Iogel, who lived on the upper floor with his wife. Iogel had two governesses sitting with him; there were plates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds on the table. The governesses were discussing whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or in Odessa. Natasha sat down, listened to their conversation with a serious, thoughtful face, and got up.::1844-03-25
Jacksonville::102480.99134217358::“What can I tell you?” said the prince, in a cold, bored tone. “Qu’a-t-on d233;cid233;? On a d233;cid233; que Buonaparte a br251;l233; ses vaisseaux, et je crois que nous sommes en train de br251;ler les n244;tres. ”§8::1934-01-15

Chelatchie::4241.334056100277::“I’m by no means saying that all the plans are good,” said Prince Andrei, “only I can’t understand how you can make such a judgment about Bonaparte. Laugh all you like, but Bonaparte is still a great general!”::1927-06-18

San Francisco::171771.04863847603::Anatole sincerely liked Dolokhov for his intelligence and daring; Dolokhov, who needed the name, noble birth, and connections of Anatole Kuragin to lure rich young men into his gambling company, used and toyed with Kuragin without letting him feel it. Apart from the calculation which made Anatole necessary for him, the very process of manipulating another person’s will was a pleasure, a habit, and a necessity for Dolokhov.::1821-09-08
Richmond Beach::101606.44390484042::“Et vous disiez, que les dames russes ne valaient pas les dames fran231;aises. Il faut savoir s’y prendre.” ‡70::1899-12-07

Behind them Boris’s head could be seen, handsome, smoothly combed, smiling, its ear inclined to Julie’s mouth. He looked at the Rostovs from under his eyebrows and, smiling, said something to his fianc233;e.::1862-08-16
Columbus::184053.75695483017::“I am an admirer of Montesquieu,” said Prince Andrei. “And his thought that ‘le principe des monarchies est l’honneur’ me para238;t incontestable.

Newhalem::374626.0271379319::Seeing the Russian general, he threw back his head with its curled, shoulder-length hair in a kingly manner and gave the French colonel a questioning glance. The colonel deferentially conveyed to his majesty the meaning of Balashov, whose family name he could not pronounce.::1930-07-19
Ford::848946.3840223782::“They barely managed to save the poor fellow,” the guest went on. “That’s how intelligently the son of Count Kirill Vladimirovich Bezukhov amuses himself!” she added. “And I heard he was so well-bred and intelligent. There’s what all this foreign upbringing leads to. I hope no one receives him here, despite his wealth. They wanted to introduce him to me. I decidedly refused: I have daughters.”::1966-11-12
Denver::875061.2717338895::“Back!” Semyon shouted at a dog that had stepped out of the bushes. The count gave a start and dropped the snuffbox. Nastasya Ivanovna dismounted and went to pick it up.::1839-04-10

El Paso::89654.0455623852::Rostov did not dare to persuade Denisov, though he felt instinctively that the way suggested by Tushin and the other officers was the surest, and though he would have considered himself very happy if he could have been of help to Denisov: he knew Denisov’s inflexible will and righteous ardor.::1915-10-19
Washington::81409.29777116634::“No, wait, ah, how funny you are!” said Nikolai, peering at her and finding in his sister as well something new, unusual, and enchantingly tender, which he had not seen in her before. “Natasha, it’s something magical, isn’t it?”::1826-08-18
Boston::817147.067518716::Kutuzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes flashed over his face as when he had turned away from Captain Timokhin. He turned away and winced, as if wishing to express thereby that all that Dolokhov had said to him and all that he could say had long, long been known to him, that it all bored him, and that it was all by no means what was needed. He turned away and made for the coach.::1922-06-22
Detroit::781492.235901693::“Bonaparte l’a dit,” *54 Prince Andrei said with a grin. (It was evident that he did not like the viscount and that, though he was not looking at him, his talk was directed against him.)::1953-10-17
Nashville::792169.8553910254::After M233;tivier’s departure, the old prince called his daughter to him, and all the force of his wrath fell upon her. It was her fault that a spy had been let in to his rooms. Yet he had told her, he had told her to make a list and not let in anyone not on the list. Why had this scoundrel been let in? She was the cause of it all. “With her he could not have a moment’s peace, he could not die in peace,” he said.::1936-01-03
Walnut Grove::945986.8074313004::“Ah, you’ll just disturb the old man!” said the countess. “And there’s no room to turn around in his place. If you go anywhere, it should be to the Melyukovs’.”::1948-07-02

Memphis::345077.4145460248::“And why has the emperor Alexander taken charge of the army? What for? War is my trade, and his business is to rule, not to command troops. Why has he taken such responsibility upon himself?”::1835-01-08
Burbank::344414.75517530605::“No, I’m going, I’m certainly going,” Natasha said resolutely. “Danilo, order horses saddled for us, and have Mikhailo ride out with my pack,” she turned to the huntsman.::1922-05-22
Silver Lake::590311.6355939255::“When did you get it? From Olm252;tz?” Prince Vassily repeats, as if he needs to know in order to settle an argument.::1912-11-23
Dash Point::248409.93655809684::The old prince came out for supper: this was obviously for Pierre’s sake. He was extremely affectionate with him on both days of his stay at Bald Hills and told him to come to visit.::1922-11-24
Woods Creek::194699.40675595953::“I’d like to know whether you loved…” Pierre did not know what to call Anatole, and he blushed at the thought of him, “whether you loved that bad man?”::1994-06-19
McKenna::636620.4639371787::Besides the persons listed, Russians and foreigners (especially the foreigners, who, with the boldness characteristic of people acting in an alien milieu, suggested new, unexpected ideas every day), there were also many secondary persons, who were with the army because their superiors were there.::1991-02-12
Island View::443693.7364827709::It was already late in the evening when they entered the Olm252;tz palace, which was occupied by the emperors and their retinues.::1892-10-21
Portland::336550.98729552113::While this Apsheronsky battalion was marching by, ruddy-faced Miloradovich, with no greatcoat, in his uniform tunic and decorations and a hat with enormous plumes, worn at an angle and brim first, galloped ahead hup-two, and with a dashing salute, reined in his horse before the sovereign.::1996-07-05
Oklahoma City::652184.1278219336::“Your Excellency, here are two trophies,” said Dolokhov, pointing to the French sword and pouch. “I captured an officer. I stopped the company.” Dolokhov was breathing heavily from fatigue; he spoke with pauses. “The whole company can testify. I ask you to remember, Your Excellency!”::1859-12-22
Las Vegas::910959.5519330896::“‘Dieu me la donne, gare 224; qui la touche,’”  he said (Bonaparte’s words, spoken as the crown was placed on him). “On dit qu’il a 233;t233; tr232;s beau en pronon231;ant ces paroles,” ‡50 he added, and repeated the words once more in Italian: “‘Dio mi la dona, guai a chi la tocca.’”::1915-11-14
Maltby::699618.5424089686::So spoke, in July 1805, the renowned Anna Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and intimate of the empress Maria Feodorovna, greeting the important and high-ranking Prince Vassily, the first to arrive at her soir233;e. Anna Pavlovna had been coughing for several days. She had the grippe,  as she put it (grippe  was a new word then, used only by rare people). Little notes had been sent out that morning with a red-liveried footman, and on all of them without distinction there was written:::2006-01-05
Louisville::535288.2215297595::Rostov saw that they had thought it out very well. Sonya had already struck him with her beauty yesterday. Today, having glimpsed her fleetingly, he thought her better still. She was a lovely sixteen-year-old girl, obviously passionately in love with him (he did not doubt it for a moment). Why shouldn’t he love her and even marry her? thought Rostov; but not now. Now there were so many other joys and things to do! “Yes, they’ve thought it out splendidly,” he thought. “I should remain free.”::1830-12-14
Blanchard::118092.55217258718::“But you are un philosophe,  so be one fully, look at things from another angle, and you’ll see that your duty is, on the contrary, to protect yourself. Let others, who are good for nothing else, do that…You weren’t told to come back, and you haven’t been dismissed from here; therefore you can stay and come with us wherever our sorry fate takes us. They say they’re going to Olm252;tz. Now, Olm252;tz is a very nice town. And you and I can calmly drive there together in my carriage.”::1885-01-24
Artondale::781103.2777375247::“Do you recognize him?” he asked. “But where has he appeared from?” the count asked Shinshin. “Didn’t he vanish somewhere?”::1832-04-25
May Creek::963184.2933308675::Dolgorukov, one of the most fervent advocates of the offensive, had just come back from the council, weary, exhausted, but animated and proud of the victory won. Prince Andrei introduced the officer he was patronizing, but Prince Dolgorukov, giving him a polite and firm handshake, said nothing to Boris and, obviously unable to keep from speaking out the thoughts that occupied him most at that moment, addressed Prince Andrei in French.::1860-08-08
Home::402055.18906049745::“It’s scary, brother, the troops we’ve gathered! Last night I looked, when they lit the fires, there was no end of them. Moscow—in short!”::1912-06-05
Vashon::166522.4992848865::A strange feeling of spite and along with that of respect for the calmness of this figure came together at that moment in Rostov’s soul.::1809-01-16
Snoqualmie Falls::127942.37400643938::“I bid you welcome. I know, I know,” said the count, kissing and embracing Denisov. “Nikolushka wrote to us…Natasha, Vera, here’s Denisov.”::1915-07-08
Laurier::5562.179213643659::But Dolokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief, pulled it off, and showed the clotted blood on his head.::2008-03-20
Baltimore::670450.4979045186::“All right, all right,” the officer said menacingly, and, turning his horse, he rode off at a trot, bouncing in the saddle.::2015-09-02
Lake McMurray::175675.4347099494::“However, it seems nobody noticed,” Rostov thought to himself. And indeed no one had noticed anything, because they were all familiar with the feeling a junker experiences when he is under fire for the first time.::1889-04-19
Martha Lake::74272.81856187685::“Quant 224; celui, Sire,”  Paulucci went on desperately, as if unable to restrain himself, “qui 224; conseill233; le camp de Drissa, je ne vois pas d’autre alternative que la maison jaune ou le gibet.” *421 Not hearing out and as if not listening to the Italian’s words, the sovereign, having recognized Bolkonsky, graciously addressed him:::1991-11-19
Ariel::47218.251313773::“What do you mean, my dear man?” Nesvitsky said, stopping, taking off his cap, and smoothing his sweat-dampened hair with a plump hand. “What do you mean I didn’t tell you to set fire to the bridge, since you put flammable material there?”::1887-05-18
Loon Lake::68499.31673239995::Dolokhov was holding the Englishman by the hand and clearly, distinctly articulating the terms of the bet, mainly addressing Anatole and Pierre.::2018-11-07
Thornton::24800.164591261997::And Boris, obviously relieving himself of a painful duty, getting out of an awkward situation himself, and putting another man in one, again became perfectly pleasant.::1839-03-04
Milwaukee::886198.9105796528::“Tomorrow we’re off, I’m giving you a place in my carriage. I’m very glad. We’ve finished everything that matters here. I should have left long ago. I have received this from the chancellor. I solicited him on your behalf, and you’ve been enrolled in the diplomatic corps and made a gentleman of the bedchamber. Now the diplomatic path is open to you.”::1804-06-06
Mirrormont::806053.1774853427::No one in the house ordered so many people around or gave them so much work as Natasha. She could not look at people indifferently, without sending them somewhere. It seemed as if she were testing whether any of them would get angry or upset with her, but people liked carrying out Natasha’s orders as they did no one else’s. “What shall I do? Where shall I go?” thought Natasha, walking slowly down the corridor.::1987-09-09
Albuquerque::678384.5603313482::“One moment, one moment, don’t come in, papa!” she cried to her father, who had opened the door, still under the gauze of her skirt, which covered her whole face. Sonya slammed the door. A moment later the count was admitted. He was wearing a dark blue tailcoat, stockings and shoes, was perfumed and pomaded.::1841-03-04
Meadowdale::454894.3558931228::They had not seen each other for nearly half a year; and at their age, when young men take their first steps on life’s path, they both found enormous changes in each other, totally new reflections of the society in which they had taken their first steps in life. Both had changed greatly since their last meeting, and both wanted the sooner to show each other the changes that had taken place in them.::2009-05-14
Cottage Lake::914974.9710364012::“What a brave fellow we’ve got here! Well, answer, what is this duel? What did you want to prove by it? What, I ask you.” Pierre shifted heavily on the sofa, opened his mouth, but could not answer.::1971-01-14
Tucson::19486.351299935257::“Because once you’ve set out on a career in military service, you should try to do all you can to make it a brilliant career.”::2015-10-13
Fresno::943901.4880039506::That evening there was a reception at Countess Elena Vassilievna’s, there was the French ambassador, there was a prince who had lately become a frequent visitor to the countess’s house, and there were many brilliant ladies and gentlemen. Pierre came downstairs, strolled through the rooms, and struck all the guests by his concentratedly distracted and gloomy look.::2012-04-16
Sacramento::353703.5786527667::“She and Pyotr Ilyich are standing across from the Zharovo thicket,” Semyon replied, smiling. “She may be a lady, but she knows a lot about hunting.”::1918-03-13
Mesa::60618.446304460784::Prince Andrei looked at Kutuzov and his eyes were involuntarily struck by the carefully washed creases of the scar on Kutuzov’s temple, a foot away from him, where the Izmail bullet had pierced his head and put out his eye. “Yes, he has the right to speak so calmly about the deaths of these people!” thought Bolkonsky.::2015-08-14
Allyn::694973.0284427826::Half an hour later the rhetor came back to transmit to the seeker the seven virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon’s temple, which every Mason was supposed to cultivate in himself. These virtues were: (1) discretion,  keeping the secrets of the order; (2) obedience  to the higher ranks of the order; (3) good morals;  (4) love of mankind;  (5) courage;  (6) generosity;  and (7) love of death.::1934-08-18
Kansas City::651363.0602262232::The second princess came out of the sick man’s room with tearful eyes and sat down next to Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a table.::1901-03-20
Barstow::652034.759788827::“Vassily Dmitrich, I thank you for the honor,” the countess said in an embarrassed tone, which seemed stern to Denisov, “but my daughter is so young, and I thought that you, as my son’s friend, would have addressed me first. In that case, you would not have brought me to the necessity of a refusal.”::1868-04-05
Tiger::393673.1458655903::And, having dismissed Mavrusha, Natasha went through the reception room to the front hall. An old servant and two young ones were playing cards. They broke off their game and stood up when the young lady came in. “What shall I do with them?” thought Natasha.::2011-12-01
Staten Island::658388.205229532::“Yes,” said the countess, when the ray of sunlight that had penetrated the room with the young generation vanished, and as if answering a question no one had asked her, but which constantly preoccupied her. “So much suffering, so much anxiety endured so as to rejoice in them now! And now, too, there’s really more fear than joy. One is afraid, always afraid! It’s precisely the age when there are so many dangers both for girls and for boys.”::1839-07-08
Junction City::671722.108630183::The princess made no reply, did not even smile, and left at once. Anna Mikhailovna took off her gloves and settled into a hard-won position in an armchair, inviting Prince Vassily to sit down beside her.::1860-11-07
Blyn::884397.9411338441::“Ah, ch232;re amie,”  answered Princess Marya, “je vous ai pri233;e de ne jamais me pr233;venir de l’humeur dans laquelle se trouve mon p232;re. Je ne me permets pas de le juger, et je ne voudrais pas que les autres le fassent.” ‡153::1826-09-19
Lakebay::328101.92990362993::In 1811 there was living in Moscow a French doctor who quickly became the fashion, a man of immense height, handsome, amiable as Frenchmen are, and, as all Moscow said, extraordinarily skillful in his profession—M233;tivier. He was received in houses of high society not as a doctor, but as an equal.::2012-03-22
Tahuya::269941.01605863986::To the left below, in the fog, exchanges of fire between unseen troops could be heard. There, it seemed to Prince Andrei, the battle would concentrate, there an obstacle would be encountered, and “it’s there that I’ll be sent with a brigade or division, and there, with a standard in my hand, I’ll go forward and crush everything ahead of me.”::1819-05-02
Atlanta::49121.165557676206::They all fell silent. The old prince looked at Rastopchin with a smile on his face, shaking his head approvingly.::1889-05-04
Kitsap Lake::824936.140826038::The princess, smiling and talking with everyone, suddenly effected the transposition, and, taking a seat, cheerily settled herself.::1840-12-06
Long Beach::230857.7959204222::He was riding almost along the front line. Several horsemen came riding in his direction. They were our life uhlans, who were returning from an attack in disorderly ranks. Rostov passed by them, involuntarily noticing that one of them was covered with blood, and rode on.::1882-06-01
Plain::699772.2403050712::“What am I to do?” he said finally. “You know, I did all a father could for their upbringing, and they both turned out des imb233;ciles.  Ippolit is at least an untroublesome fool, but Anatole is a troublesome one. That’s the only difference,” he said, smiling more unnaturally and animatedly than usual, and with that showing especially clearly in the wrinkles that formed around his mouth something unexpectedly coarse and disagreeable.::1952-08-07
Tanner::893882.9977377029::Anatole left the room and came back in a few moments wearing a fur coat with a silver belt and a sable hat, dashingly cocked to one side, which was very becoming to his handsome face. After looking in the mirror, he stood in front of Dolokhov in the same posture he had assumed in front of the mirror and took a glass of wine.::1866-09-06
Colorado Springs::248430.31624185375::During the first period of his acquaintance with Speransky, Prince Andrei had a passionate feeling of admiration for him, resembling what he used to feel for Bonaparte. The circumstance that Speransky was a priest’s son whom stupid people could vulgarly despise, as many did, for being a little cleric and a “preacher’s brat,” made Prince Andrei treat his feeling for Speransky with special care and unconsciously strengthen it within himself.::1965-05-14
North Hill::693279.5178212256::“Lazarev!” the colonel commanded, frowning, and Lazarev, the first soldier in the rank, briskly stepped forward.::1886-08-22
Raleigh::49742.28725694629::“Bonaparte l’a dit,” *54 Prince Andrei said with a grin. (It was evident that he did not like the viscount and that, though he was not looking at him, his talk was directed against him.)::1861-12-18
Monse::929735.0875174283::“Devil take you and your Karl Ivanych!” He picked up the glass with the drops of medicine in it and went back again.::1896-05-21
Miami::925611.96436759::And it suddenly became clear to Sonya that Natasha had some terrible plan for that night. Sonya knocked on her door. Natasha did not let her in.::1851-06-18
Marlin::455316.7234761697::“Adjutant! Mister Adjutant!…For God’s sake…protect us…What’s it all about?…I’m the wife of the doctor of the seventh chasseurs…they won’t let us pass; we couldn’t keep up, lost our people…”::1880-05-16
Chinook::533275.8500544173::“Yes, what’s that other unpleasantness he writes?” Prince Andrei recalled the contents of his father’s letter. “Yes. Our side has won a victory over Bonaparte precisely when I’m not serving. Yes, yes, he keeps making fun of me…well, he’s welcome to…” And he began to read Bilibin’s letter, written in French. He read, not understanding half of it, read only so as to stop thinking for at least a minute about what he had been thinking of exclusively and painfully for all too long.::1915-09-07
Virginia Beach::478304.73748865223::“Look at papa,” Natasha shouted to the whole ballroom (completely forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up), bending her curly head to her knees and dissolving into her ringing laughter for the whole ballroom to hear.::1986-01-17
Omaha::70940.64632020547::“J’ai apport233; mon ouvrage,” †28 she said, unclasping her reticule and addressing them all together.::1934-07-03
Oakland::454003.68471736606::“If he, however, is senior to mine in the ranking,” the German hussar colonel said, turning red and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, “leave him to do as he wants. I my hussars cannot sacrifice. Bugler! Sound the retreat!”::1939-04-14
Minneapolis::359308.0651688836::“Ah, my friend, he’s very unfortunate,” she said. “If what we’ve heard is true, it’s terrible. And could we have thought of it when we rejoiced over his happiness? And such a lofty, heavenly soul, this young Bezukhov! Yes, I pity him with all my soul, and I’ll try to give him comfort, as far as it depends on me.”::1809-07-22
Wishram::766990.2733605484::He touched up his horse and, calling to him the column leader Miloradovich, gave him the order to advance.::1845-05-12
Cascade Valley::836947.2676099477::“Au moins changez la coiffure,”  said the little princess. “Je vous disais,”  she said with reproach, turning to Mlle Bourienne, “Marie a une de ces figures, auxquelles ce genre de coiffure ne vas pas du tout. Mais du tout, du tout. Changez de gr226;ce.” §244::1878-08-03

Amboy::73604.2054410584::“Tr232;s dr244;le, mon monsieur prince,” *222 said the staff officer on duty. (He remembered that there was some special way of addressing a prince in French, but was unable to get it right.)::2018-10-07
Centerville::606613.5068059248::“That’s my Mitka the coachman…I bought him a good balalaika, I like it,” said the uncle. It was the uncle’s custom that, when he came back from the hunt, Mitka would play the balalaika in the bachelor hunters’ room. The uncle liked listening to this music.::1961-04-08
Verlot::446061.80856653076::Having ridden past some Austrian troops, Rostov noticed that the next part of the line (this was the guards) had already gone into action.::2015-04-09
Alstown::906215.5998098904::After his talk with his wife, Pierre went to Petersburg. At the Torzhok posting station there were no horses, or else the postmaster did not want to give them to him. Pierre had to wait. Without undressing, he lay down on a leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big feet in their warm boots on the table, and lapsed into thought.::1813-05-12
Synarep::562734.1201610303::In the evening Prince Vassily arrived. He was met on the “avenue” (as they called the front drive) by the coachmen and servants, who with shouts dragged his carts and sleigh to the wing over the road that had been deliberately covered with snow.::1816-12-19
Annapolis::943922.2757697605::“All is lost?” he repeated. “If I were not I, but the handsomest, brightest, and best man in the world, and I was free, I would go on my knees this minute and ask for your hand and your love.”::1961-05-05
Port Gamble::85725.50910915755::“What does that prove?” he was saying as Rostov rode up to them. “They could retreat and leave pickets.”::1987-05-20
Tulsa::854350.7900574004::“Why the postponement? Why no betrothal?” he thought. Talking with his mother once about his sister, he found, to his surprise and partly to his satisfaction, that deep in her heart his mother also sometimes looked mistrustfully at this marriage.::1907-07-25
Similk Beach::608360.069584857::“You do get angry, though, brother,” said the count. Danilo said nothing and just shyly smiled his childishly meek and pleasant smile.::1938-11-16
Cougar::507612.61373389343::The sovereign’s indecision lasted only a moment. The sovereign’s foot, in the narrow, sharp toe of its boot, as they wore them then, touched the belly of the bobtailed bay mare he was riding; the sovereign’s hand in its white glove picked up the reins, and he set off, accompanied by a disorderly swaying sea of adjutants. He rode further and further, stopping by other regiments, and at last Rostov could only see his white plumes beyond the suite that surrounded the emperors.::1940-11-14
Eglon::931036.6677561235::“But what’s worst of all, gentlemen—I’m betraying Kuragin to you—is that the man is in misfortune, and this Don Juan, this terrible fellow, is taking advantage of it!”::1839-05-20
Paterson::352980.3007949042::The princess glanced at her watch and noticing that she was already five minutes late for playing the clavichord, went with a frightened face to the sitting room.

You know it yourself. Well, now your father will come tomorrow, and what am I to tell him? Eh?”::1905-04-08
New Orleans::568433.846549575::When the review was over, the officers, both the newly arrived and Kutuzov’s, began to gather in groups, and talk sprang up about rewards, about the Austrians and their uniforms, about their front, about Bonaparte and how bad things were going to be for him now, especially when the corps from Essen also arrives and Prussia takes our side.::2004-02-14
Alger::70036.92597354994::“You do know her husband?” said Anna Pavlovna, closing her eyes and pointing to H233;l232;ne with a sad gesture. “Ah, she’s such an unhappy and lovely woman! Don’t speak of him in her presence, please don’t speak of him. It’s too painful for her!”::1912-12-16

Fragaria::52497.701275710184::“You know, I’ve entrusted him with our secret,” said Prince Andrei. “I’ve known him since childhood. He has a heart of gold. I beg you, Natalie,” he suddenly said earnestly, “I’m going away. God knows what may happen. You may stop lov…Well, I know I mustn’t talk about that. One thing—whatever happens with you while I’m not here…”::2009-11-17
Green Bluff::781790.0392064356::The vicomte  told very nicely the then current anecdote that the duc d’Enghien had secretly gone to Paris to meet with Mlle George, and that there he had met Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress’s favors, and that there, having met the duke, Napoleon happened to fall into one of those faints he was prone to and found himself in the duke’s power, which the duke did not take advantage of, and that Bonaparte afterwards revenged himself for this magnanimity with the duke’s death.::1892-08-15
Woodmont Beach::302016.39397715084::“Mon cher, avec nos cinq cent mille hommes de troupes, il serait facile d’avoir un beau style,” †362 said Count Rastopchin. Pierre understood why Count Rastopchin was disturbed by the wording of the note.::1889-07-15

Tampa::389552.7827312602::The thought of defeat and flight could not enter Rostov’s head. Though he saw French guns and troops precisely on the Pratzen heights, in the very place where he had been told to look for the commander in chief, he could not and would not believe it.::1930-04-01
Clayton::634290.9650416799::He leaned his elbow on the table, the quill in his hand, and, obviously glad of the chance to quickly speak out everything he wanted to write, began reciting his letter to Rostov.::2012-10-05
Bakersfield::951852.8333022257::“Papa, I didn’t want to judge,” Prince Andrei said in a bilious and hard tone, “but you challenged me, and I’ve said and will always say that Princess Marya is not to blame, but the one to blame…the one to blame is this Frenchwoman…”::1918-10-04
White Swan::818995.8868410492::“Not yet, ” Napoleon put in, and, as if afraid of giving way to his emotion, he frowned and inclined his head slightly, thereby letting Balashov feel that he could go on.::1812-01-13
Camano::689771.478168572::His wound, despite its insignificance, still had not healed, though it was now six weeks since he was wounded. His face had the same pale swollenness of all the hospital faces. But it was not this that struck Rostov: what struck him was that Denisov did not seem glad to see him and smiled at him unnaturally. Denisov did not ask about the regiment, nor about the general course of affairs. When Rostov mentioned it, Denisov did not listen.::1962-06-03
Cedar Grove::72854.88084665415::“And now Dolokhov—sitting on the snow, with a forced smile, maybe dying, and responding to my regret with some sort of swagger!”::1894-10-02
Winton::255773.25061518853::Noticing on Balashov’s face the unpleasant impression produced by this reception, Davout raised his head and coldly asked what he wanted.::1954-11-03
East Olympia::692656.0332189542::Having ridden past some Austrian troops, Rostov noticed that the next part of the line (this was the guards) had already gone into action.::1983-08-10
Sunset Beach::435738.9892175155::“No, quite the opposite—he had a cheerful face, and he turned to me,” and the moment she said it, she herself thought she had seen what she said.::2007-04-03
Belfair::947704.4866630238::The princess said nothing, and her short lip with its little mustache suddenly trembled. Prince Andrei, getting up and shrugging his shoulders, began to pace the room.::1862-11-04
Oso::881454.2977185455::“Very glad to see you, Prince,” he said. “Just a moment…” he turned to Magnitsky, interrupting his story. “We’ve agreed that tonight will be a dinner for pleasure and not a word about business.” He turned back to the speaker and laughed again.::1866-10-25
Aurora::794388.5461420676::“You do get angry, though, brother,” said the count. Danilo said nothing and just shyly smiled his childishly meek and pleasant smile.::1895-12-12
Scandia::981904.1759737646::“Buonaparte?” Bilibin said questioningly, wrinkling his forehead and with that letting it be felt that a mot  was coming. “Buonaparte?” he said with special emphasis on the u . “I think, however, that now that he’s prescribing laws for Austria from Sch246;nbrunn, il faut lui faire gr226;ce de l ’u. I decidedly make an innovation and call him Bonaparte tout court. ”§200::1948-11-03
Quilcene::318319.33143148315::At the beginning of winter, Prince Nikolai Andreich Bolkonsky came to Moscow with his daughter. Because of his past, because of his intelligence and originality, and especially because of the weakening just then of the raptures over the reign of Alexander I, and because of the anti-French and patriotic tendencies which reigned at that time in Moscow, Prince Nikolai Andreich at once became an object of special deference among the Muscovites and the center of Moscow opposition to the government.::1819-06-22
Covada::308367.86654260126::“What is this? What is this? Who’s being shot at? Who’s shooting?” asked Rostov, drawing even with Russian and Austrian soldiers running in mixed crowds across his path.::1908-08-19
Honolulu::169462.97221985186::Sonya walked wrapped in her fur coat. She was two steps away before she saw him; she also saw him not as she had known him and had always been a little afraid of him. He was in a woman’s dress, with tousled hair and a happy smile that was new for Sonya. Sonya quickly ran to him.::1960-01-03
Juanita::622676.6867634172::“What is it? What’s wrong?” asked both princesses, seeing Prince Andrei and the momentarily emerging figure of the old man in a white smock, wigless, and in an old man’s spectacles, shouting in an angry voice.::1902-08-05
Molson::78006.23184754462::“We’re going,” Nikolai answered reluctantly, being intent on some serious wolf hunting that day and not wanting to bring Natasha and Petya along. “We’re going, but only for wolves: you’d be bored.”::1838-11-18
Daisy::273048.7465760145::“No, Sonya, do you remember him so as to remember everything, remember really well,” said Natasha, with an assiduous gesture, evidently wishing to give her words the most serious meaning. “I remember Nikolenka, too, I do,” she said. “But not Boris. I don’t remember him at all.”::1897-11-08
Anaheim::15447.633587961529::“I’ve got four sons in the army, and I’m not grieving. It’s all God’s will: you can die in your sleep, and God can spare you in battle,” the dense voice of Marya Dmitrievna rang out effortlessly from the other end of the table.::2008-02-07
Santa Ana::332716.1904782425::“Look, they’re scurrying around! It’s burning! Look at the smoke! Fine work! Grand! What smoke, what smoke!” said the crews, growing animated.::1978-12-02
Corpus Christi::736170.7447757554::“Non plus. Cela met la cour dans de trop mauvais draps,”  Bilibin went on. “Ce n’est ni trahison, ni l226;chet233;, ni b234;tise; c’est comme 224; Ulm…”  It was as if he fell to pondering, searching for a phrase: “C’est…c’est du Mack. Nous somme mack233;s,” †213 he concluded, feeling that he had uttered a mot,  and a fresh mot,  a mot  that would be repeated.::1830-01-14
Venersborg::147774.40893700978::But while Nikolai was working out all these questions within himself, still without giving himself a clear accounting of what confused him so much, the wheel of fortune of military service, as often happens, turned in his favor. After the Ostrovna action he was promoted, was given a battalion of hussars, and whenever a brave officer was called for, the mission was given to him.::1803-11-22
Riverside::312848.73224014096::Pierre, his shoulders hunched and his mouth gaping, listened to what Marya Dmitrievna was telling him and could not believe his ears. Prince Andrei’s fianc233;e, so deeply loved, this once sweet Natasha Rostov, to exchange Bolkonsky for that fool Anatole, who was already married (Pierre knew the secret of his marriage), and fall in love with him so much as to agree to elope with him!—that Pierre could not understand and could not imagine.::1846-08-14
Fairmont::849576.1257891991::“The thing is, my friend—what’s this stain you’ve got there?” she said, pointing to his waistcoat. “Must be the saut233;, ” she added, smiling. “The thing is, Count, that I need money.”::2003-03-02
Lexington::52919.32728790693::“I want him…  now, this minute, I want him, ” Natasha said, her eyes glistening and not smiling. The countess raised her head and looked intently at her daughter.::1917-08-13
East Port Orchard::605943.5145546602::“Adorable, divin, d233;licieux!” *383 came from all sides. Natasha looked at the fat George, but heard nothing, saw and understood nothing of what went on before her; she only felt herself again quite irretrievably in that strange, insane world, so far from her former one, that world in which it was impossible to know what was good, what was bad, what was sane and what insane. Behind her sat Anatole, and she, sensing his nearness, waited fearfully for something.::2018-08-15
North Omak::724440.886934407::“But the doctor hasn’t come from Moscow yet,” said the princess. (At the wishes of Liza and Prince Andrei, they had sent to Moscow in due time for an accoucheur, and he was expected at any moment.)::1831-03-06
East Farms::923482.4301082208::It was obvious that Balashov’s person did not interest him in the least. It was clear that only what went on in his  soul was of interest to him. Everything that was outside him had no meaning for him, because everything in the world, as it seemed to him, depended only upon his will.::1822-01-07
Eschbach::599294.3606451842::“Here are her letters,” he said, “and her portrait.” He took the bundle from the table and handed it to Pierre.::1820-09-18
Chattaroy::864836.7859124903::“I am an admirer of Montesquieu,” said Prince Andrei. “And his thought that ‘le principe des monarchies est l’honneur’ me para238;t incontestable. Certains droits et privil232;ges de la noblesse me paraissent 234;tre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment. ”*339::1998-07-21
Inchelium::123460.69990668917::Boris was the first to learn the news of French troops crossing the Niemen and thanks to that had the chance to show certain important persons that much of what was concealed from others was known to him, and thereby had the chance to rise higher in the opinion of those persons.::1923-01-10
Maxwelton::483132.3937758705::“Herself,” a rough female voice was heard in reply, after which Marya Dmitrievna came into the room.::1823-12-03
White Center::380160.8290479135::Kochubey said a few words about the reception Arakcheev had given Bolkonsky. Speransky’s smile widened.::2012-10-15
Saint Louis::208822.88790786752::“Ah, what a Daniel Cooper!” said Marya Dmitrievna, letting out a long, deep breath and pushing up her sleeves.::1858-08-02
Stockton::796629.8442038351::“Now you have seen the lesser light,” someone’s voice said to him. Then candles were lit again, the voices said he must see the full light, and his eyes were uncovered again, and more than ten voices suddenly said: “Sic transit gloria mundi.” *292::1885-10-03
Pittsburgh::257847.4932055387::“Andr233;,” said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish tone in which she addressed others, “what a story the viscount told us about mademoiselle  George and Bonaparte!”::1950-04-10
Saint Paul::939613.3770749865::Everyone fell silent: about this fact, which referred personally to the sovereign, it was impossible to express any opinion.::1854-09-05
Cincinnati::323722.50038339803::“Yes, of course it’s right,” said Anatole, who obviously was not listening to Dolokhov, and, with a smile that never left his face, he looked straight ahead.::1920-11-25
Anchorage::468026.6592872058::“My darling!” he spoke words he had never said to her before. “God is merciful…” She looked at him questioningly with childlike reproach.::1887-07-03

McMillin::151995.71500763486::“If I were in Nikolushka’s place, I’d have killed even more of those Frenchmen,” he said, “they’re so disgusting! I’d have cut down so many, there’d be a whole pile,” Petya went on.::1816-07-11
La Grande::89072.88445110973::“Gentlemen, the disposition for tomorrow, for today even (because it’s already past twelve), cannot be changed,” he said. “You have heard it, and we will all do our duty. And there’s nothing more important before a battle…” (he paused) “than a good night’s sleep.”::1932-02-24
Cromwell::384321.51560102246::After his talk with his wife, Pierre went to Petersburg. At the Torzhok posting station there were no horses, or else the postmaster did not want to give them to him. Pierre had to wait. Without undressing, he lay down on a leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big feet in their warm boots on the table, and lapsed into thought.::1844-11-15
Berrydale::285883.5455522548::“Well, as you will,” said the staff captain. “So, what’s become of the blackguard now?” he asked Denisov.::1935-05-23
Greensboro::517165.1999295408::The island of the Otradnoe reserve could be seen about two hundred yards away, and the kennelmen were approaching it. Rostov, having come to a final decision with the uncle about where to set on the hounds, and pointing Natasha to a place where she could stand and where nothing could ever run out, he went to circle around above the ravine.::1970-04-10
Urban::50887.36016704576::“Hm! this excellence  is a little brat…I solicited his post for him in the ministry,” the prince said peevishly. “And why the son, I cannot comprehend. Princess Lizaveta Karlovna and Princess Marya may know, but I don’t know why they’re bringing this son here. I have no need of him.” And he looked at his blushing daughter.::1893-07-19
Maplewood::200110.85727108148::Prince Ippolit went over to the little princess and, bringing his face down close to hers, began saying something to her in a half whisper. Two footmen, one the princess’s, the other his, waiting for them to finish talking, stood with shawl and redingote and listened to their French talk, which they could not understand, with such faces as if they understood what was being said but did not want to show it. The princess, as usual, talked smilingly and listened laughingly.::1927-12-11
Marys Corner::682114.6918422283::Liza’s little lip lowered. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law’s face and again wept unexpectedly.::1870-03-11
Plano::825871.2243119858::“Have you seen yet” or “have you made the acquaintance of ma tante? ”†26 Anna Pavlovna said to the arriving guests, and led them quite seriously to a little old lady in high ribbons, who had come sailing out of the next room as soon as the guests began to arrive, called them by name, slowly shifting her gaze from the guest to ma tante,  and then walked away.::1804-05-21
Cove::487753.4247063797::To Rostov’s renewed questions, Denisov, laughing, said that it seemed somebody else had turned up there, but it was all nonsense, trifles, that he did not even dream of being afraid of any courts, and that if those scoundrels dared to provoke him, he would give them an answer they would remember.::1865-08-25
Chico::972664.9624659301::Boris smiled cautiously, so that his smile could be understood either as mockery or as approval of the joke, depending on how it was received. Everyone laughed.::1963-08-03
Maple Falls::858922.4527532418::“Well, all right, all right,” cried Denisov, “now there’s no getting out of it, you owe us a barcarolle,  I beg you.”::1838-04-20
Colvos::55433.37574939866::“The thing is, my dear…” the count said to the deferential young man as he came in. “Bring me…” He pondered. “Yes, yes, seven hundred roubles. And see that you don’t bring torn and dirty ones like the other time, but nice ones, for the countess.”::1930-06-17

Pine Lake::76606.33974352283::“Sire, je vous demande la permission de donner la L233;gion d’honneur au plus brave de vos soldats,” *333 said a sharp, precise voice, articulating every letter.::2015-01-19
Tampico::581392.4724659551::“In the beginning I didn’t like it much, because what is it that makes a city pleasant? Ce sont les jolies femmes, *376 isn’t that so? Well, but now I like it very much,” he said, looking at her meaningfully. “Will you come to this carousel, Countess? Please do come,” he said and, reaching his hand out to her bouquet and lowering his voice, he said: “Vous serez la plus jolie. Venez, ch232;re comtesse, et comme gage donnez-moi cette fleur.” †377::1907-03-22
Newark::761128.7082538463::Balashov took out the packet that contained the sovereign’s letter and placed it on the table (a table consisting of a door with ripped off hinges sticking out from it, laid over two barrels). Davout took the envelope and read what was written on it.::1871-10-06

Lincoln::867677.9618451418::Only to the old countess, in bed at night, would Natasha have been able to tell everything she thought. She knew that Sonya, with her strict and wholesome view, would either understand nothing or be horrified by her confession. Natasha, alone with herself, tried to resolve what was tormenting her.::1963-01-16
Toledo::778455.5374551121::“I haven’t called on you all this time, because I was at my father’s: I had to discuss a very important matter. I came back only last night,” he said, glancing at Natasha. “I must talk with you, Countess,” he added after a moment’s silence.::1932-06-09
Orlando::28094.393206080647::“Why is it others see things, and I don’t?” she said. “Well, you sit down, Sonya; you must do it tonight,” she said. “In my place…I feel so frightened tonight!”::1810-10-08

Jersey City::327916.33203136927::“Yes, if you put the question that way, it’s another matter,” said Prince Andrei. “I build a house and cultivate a garden, and you build hospitals.

Well, you want to argue,” he added, “so let’s argue.” They left the table and sat on the porch, which took the place of a balcony.::1831-12-15

Mohler::537988.3646188029::In the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to Petersburg. He could not remain under the same roof with her.

She looked at them with that expression they knew, an expression of thought and sadness. This expression did not inspire any fear of Princess Marya in them.

Chandler::984745.515316438::The next day Rostov saw off Denisov, who did not want to remain in Moscow a day longer. All Denisov’s Moscow friends were seeing him off at the Gypsies’, and he did not remember how he was put in the sleigh and driven the first three posting stations.::1883-07-18
Scottsdale::870995.1910142382::“So it’s right?” said Nikolai, once more searching into the expression of his sister’s face to find out if it was true, and, his boots creaking, he jumped off the fender and ran to his sleigh.

Glendale::918309.678212146::They stood silently facing each other. The old man’s quick eyes were aimed straight into his son’s eyes. Something twitched in the lower part of the old prince’s face.::1922-04-23
Eldon::352705.24072062515::“Eh, mon cher vicomte,”  Anna Pavlovna mixed in, “l’Urope”  (for some reason she pronounced it l’Urope,  as if it was some special subtlety of the French language, which she could allow herself when speaking with a Frenchman), “l’Urope ne sera jamais notre alli233;e sinc232;re.” §301::1917-12-10

Vashon Heights::154781.4684693799::“What’s the matter with her?” Pierre wondered, glancing at her. She was sitting beside her sister at the tea table and replied reluctantly, without looking at him, to something Boris said as he sat down by her. Having gone through a whole suit and taken five tricks, much to his partner’s delight, Pierre, who heard an exchange of greetings and the sound of someone’s footsteps coming into the room as he was gathering in his tricks, looked at her again.::1921-04-25
Salmon Creek::34810.65656094462::“Little countess,” the count’s voice came from outside the door. “Are you asleep?” Natasha jumped up barefoot and, snatching her slippers, ran to her room.::1811-05-06

Norfolk::342592.37802128115::“Really! Swear to God!” replied Natasha, straightening a strand of stiff hair that had come loose from her friend’s braid.::1935-06-22
Winston-Salem::735663.6393398454::Sitting in the drawing room and listening to this talk and gossip among the old men, Princess Marya understood nothing of what she heard; she was thinking only of whether the guests had noticed her father’s hostile attitude towards her. She did not even notice the special attention and courtesy shown her during that dinner by Drubetskoy, who was already visiting their house for the third time.::1930-07-13
Silver Firs::517029.7588296581::“Well, let her sleep,” said Marya Dmitrievna, going out of the room, thinking she was asleep. But Natasha was not asleep, and her fixed, wide-open eyes looked straight ahead from her pale face. Natasha did not sleep all that night, did not weep, and did not speak with Sonya, who got up several times and went over to her.::1992-12-05
Plaza::204375.25138011127::Another voice, that of a not very tall man with clear blue eyes, especially striking amidst all these drunken voices by its sober expression, shouted from the window: “Come here—break the grip!” This was Dolokhov, an officer of the Semyonovsky regiment, a notorious gambler and duellist, who lived with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking around merrily.::1963-02-05

Malo::625081.9564713264::“Can it be that he’s my husband, precisely this stranger, this handsome, kind man—above all, kind,” thought Princess Marya, and fear, which hardly ever came to her, came over her now. She was afraid to look around; she fancied someone was standing there behind the screen, in the dark corner. And that someone was he—the devil—and he was this man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red mouth.::2011-12-11
North Las Vegas::598061.9238910693::“That’s entirely as you will, ma’am,” said Prince Nikolai Andreevich, bowing and scraping before his daughter-in-law, “but she needn’t make herself ugly—she’s plain enough as it is.”::1802-02-23

Outlook::502612.07179579395::“Awaiting orders, Your Excellency, to be dispatched to my new assignment,” replied Boris, showing neither vexation at the prince’s abrupt tone, nor the wish to get into conversation, but so calmly and deferentially that the prince looked at him intently.::1873-12-08
Clinton::935094.6575983774::Prince Vassily fell silent, and his cheeks began to twitch nervously now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant expression which never appeared on Prince Vassily’s face when he was in a drawing room. His eyes were also not the same as usual: now they looked with insolent jocularity, now they glanced around fearfully.::1879-06-02
Evans::835919.1846599004::Natasha did not allow her to finish, pulled the countess’s big hand towards her and kissed it on the back, then on the palm, then turned it again and began to kiss it on one knuckle, then in between, then on the next knuckle, murmuring in a whisper: “January, February, March, April, May.”::1943-03-04
Browns Point::115779.70272871363::The countess, learning at once through the maids of what had happened in the wing, was, on the one hand, calmed by the reflection that their situation should now be set to rights, but, on the other hand, was troubled by the thought of how her son would put up with it. She tiptoed to his door several times, listening as he smoked one pipe after another.::1908-07-10
Chesapeake::493317.7839330293::“The master’s not at home, he’s gone to the staff,” Telyanin’s orderly told him. “Has something happened?” the orderly added, surprised to see the junker’s upset face.::1833-10-24

You understand, given the count’s merits, his request would be granted…”::1904-01-18
Ahtanum::792612.0300911926::Prince Andrei, without raising his eyes, hastily rode away from the doctor’s wife, who was calling him her savior, and, recalling with disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene, rode on towards the village where he had been told the commander in chief was.::1995-05-19
Gilbert::98752.3286537273::Prince Vassily always spoke lazily, the way an actor speaks a role in an old play. Anna Pavlovna Scherer, on the contrary, despite her forty years, was brimming with animation and impulses.::2018-12-16
Hyak::537203.1120897771::“You’re a scoundrel and a villain, and I don’t know what restrains me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this,” said Pierre, expressing himself so artificially because he was speaking in French.

Fife Heights::73353.01148508578::As rumor had it, the purpose of sending Savary was to propose peace and to propose a meeting between the emperor Alexander and Napoleon. A personal meeting, to the joy and pride of the whole army, was refused, and instead of the sovereign, Prince Dolgorukov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate with Napoleon, on the chance that these negotiations, contrary to expectation, had as their purpose a real desire for peace.::1810-01-22
Manson::313045.6646879126::The regimental commander was afraid that he might be blamed for that and made no reply. Just then the officer noticed the face of the captain with the red nose and drawn-in stomach and mimicked his face and pose so perfectly that Nesvitsky could not keep from laughing. Kutuzov turned around. It was clear that the officer could control his face at will: the moment Kutuzov turned around, the officer managed to make a scowl and then assume a most serious, deferential, and innocent expression.::1938-12-10
Baton Rouge::165264.86072631818::During this act, Natasha, each time she glanced at the parterre, saw Anatole Kuragin, his arm flung over the back of his seat, looking at her.

Nine Mile Falls::114427.91656551354::Princess Marya looked at him with astonishment. She did not understand how it was even possible to ask about it. Pierre went into the study.

Tacoma::226480.76162116483::“And for that alone the state has paid millions!” he said. “We want to give new judicial powers to the senate, but we have no laws. Which is why it’s a sin, Prince, for people such as you not to serve now.”::1879-08-20
Fontana::652584.607499275::“This one? Yes, she’s a good dog, a catcher,” Ilagin said in an indifferent voice of his red-spotted Yerza, for whom he had given his neighbor three families of house serfs a year before. “So with you, too, Count, there’s no boasting about flour production this year?” he continued the conversation.

Cavalero Corner::129990.71196342116::He was riding almost along the front line. Several horsemen came riding in his direction.

Markham::105049.24434800723::“Don’t be wicked,” Anna Pavlovna said from the other end of the table, shaking her finger, “c’est un si brave et excellent homme notre bon Viasmitinoff…” *234::1885-05-21

Huntington Beach::270969.46405706345::The hospital was in a little Prussian village twice ravaged by Russian and French troops.

Ardenvoir::216248.15132145592::Now it was not, as before, an invisible river flowing in the darkness, but like a gloomy sea subsiding and quivering after a storm.

An infantryman came up to the fire, squatted down, put his hands to the fire, and turned his face away.::1967-09-20

Akron::353319.7155715687::“Look at papa,” Natasha shouted to the whole ballroom (completely forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up), bending her curly head to her knees and dissolving into her ringing laughter for the whole ballroom to hear.::1811-06-06
Danville::185461.77064928648::Prince Andrei said nothing to Tushin. The two men were so busy that they seemed not even to see each other. Having limbered up the two remaining guns of the four (one smashed cannon and a unicorn20 were abandoned), Prince Andrei rode up to Tushin.::1842-05-09

Valley::181743.11810338972::“Je ne serai pas violent, ne craignez rien,” *387 said Pierre, responding to Anatole’s gesture of fear. “Letters—one,” said Pierre, as if repeating a lesson to himself. “Second,” he went on after a moment’s silence, getting up again and beginning to pace the room, “tomorrow you are to leave Moscow.”::1944-01-17
Columbus::374965.79644659546::“And I could be in his place!” Rostov thought to himself and, barely holding back tears of pity over the sovereign’s fate, rode on in complete despair, not knowing where he was going now or why.::1900-11-10
Augusta::109474.78802180977::At the Rostovs’ it was the name day of the Natalyas, mother and younger daughter.24 Since morning, coach and sixes had constantly been driving up and leaving, bringing people with congratulations to the big house of the countess Rostov on Povarskaya Street, which was known to all Moscow.

Shreveport::480548.1511677222::As if by the sounds of the most cheerful music, Rostov felt cheered at heart by these sounds, which he had not heard for so long. Trap-ta-ta-tap!—several shots clapped out, now together, now in rapid succession. Then all fell silent, and then came the crackling again, as if someone was walking on firecrackers.::1891-08-14

Huntsville::475752.36815336265::Princess Marya had long ago abandoned her book: she was sitting silently, her luminous eyes fixed on her nanny’s wrinkled face, familiar to her in the smallest detail: on the lock of gray hair that strayed from under her kerchief, at the little pouch of skin that hung under her chin.::1872-09-11
Mobile::840570.9777541703::“Why did they write, why did Liza tell me about it all? It just can’t be!” she kept saying to herself, looking in the mirror. “How will I come out to the drawing room?

Randle::785782.397997227::“This is the same room, I’ve been told, in which the emperor Alexander lived.

Knoxville::78810.71294703346::“So you’re not afraid to gamble with me?” Dolokhov repeated, and, as if in order to tell a merry story, he set the cards down, leaned back in his chair, and, with a smile, slowly began to speak:::1836-11-18
Snoqualmie Pass::782488.4285037954::War and Peace  is the most famous and at the same time the most daunting of Russian novels, as vast as Russia itself and as long to cross from one end to the other. Yet if one makes the journey, the sights seen and the people met on the way mark one’s life forever. The book is set in the period of the Napoleonic wars (1805–1812) and tells of the interweaving of historical events with the private lives of two very different families of the Russian nobility—the severe Bolkonskys and the easygoing Rostovs—and of a singular man, reminiscent of the author himself—Count Pierre Bezukhov. It embodies the national myth of “Russia’s glorious period,” as Tolstoy himself called it, in the confrontation of the emperor Napoleon and Field Marshal Kutuzov, and at the same time it challenges that myth and all such myths through the vivid portrayal of the fates of countless ordinary people of the period, men and women, young and old, French as well as Russian, and through the author’s own passionate questioning of the truth of history.::1988-04-06
Bangor::965302.5370137899::Anatole, whom he had been seeking, dined that day at Dolokhov’s and discussed with him how to mend the spoiled affair. It seemed necessary to him that he see Miss Rostov. In the evening, he went to his sister’s, to discuss with her the means of arranging this meeting. When Pierre, having driven in vain all over Moscow, returned home, the valet told him that Prince Anatole Vassilievich was with the countess.

Well, so all the Moscow ladies are losing their minds! Dolochoff le Persan,  and all’s said. Now no word is spoken among us without Dolokhov; they swear by him, they invite people for him as if he was a sterlet,” said Shinshin. “Dolokhov and Anatole Kuragin have driven all our ladies out of their minds.”::1911-04-17

Dalkena::14963.09172936061::“Prince Vassily. He was very nice. He agreed at once to do everything and reported to the emperor,” Princess Anna Mikhailovna said with rapture, forgetting entirely about all the humiliation she had gone through to achieve her goal.::1846-07-16
Leland::946522.54177119::After M233;tivier’s departure, the old prince called his daughter to him, and all the force of his wrath fell upon her. It was her fault that a spy had been let in to his rooms. Yet he had told her, he had told her to make a list and not let in anyone not on the list. Why had this scoundrel been let in? She was the cause of it all. “With her he could not have a moment’s peace, he could not die in peace,” he said.::1981-09-20
Fruitvale::855418.7356271268::The curtain rose again. Anatole left the box calm and cheerful. Natasha returned to her father’s box, now totally subjected to the world she was in. Everything that was happening before her now seemed perfectly natural to her; but instead all her former thoughts about her fianc233;, about Princess Marya, about country life, never once entered her head, as if it was all long ago, long past.::1958-04-02
Port Hadlock::238144.8875247484::He said that our wars with Bonaparte would be unsuccessful so long as we sought alliance with the Germans and meddled in the affairs of Europe, which we had been drawn into by the peace of Tilsit. We had no need to fight either for or against Austria. Our politics all lie in the East, and in relation to Bonaparte there is one thing—armed borders and firm politics—and he will never dare cross Russian borders as in the year seven.::1907-12-12
Brownsville::843303.372380121::Neither her father and mother, nor Sonya, nor Prince Andrei himself could have foreseen how parting with her fianc233; would affect Natasha. Flushed and agitated, her eyes dry, she wandered about the house that day, occupying herself with the most insignificant things, as if not understanding what awaited her.

Tempe::557618.7030086787::“It’s cleverly written, there’s no saying it’s not,” said Tushin. “But that’s not the point, Vassily Dmitrich,” he also turned to Rostov, “a man ought to submit, but Vassily Dmitrich here doesn’t want to. The auditor told you your case was going badly.”::1966-03-09
Deep River::657664.9818215069::Having gone past the guards and an empty space, Rostov, to avoid getting into the front line again, as he had during the attack of the horse guards, followed the line of the reserves, making a wide circle around the place where the hottest shooting and cannon fire were heard.

Elberton::978419.583313599::Rostov watched what was happening before him as if it was a hunting scene. He sensed intuitively that if he were now to strike the French dragoons with his hussars, they would not hold out; but if he were to strike, it would have to be now, at this moment, otherwise it would be too late. He looked around. A captain was standing next to him, his eyes also fixed on the cavalry below.::1829-08-07
Kingston::343614.63107464893::“Well, that’s it,” thought Rostov, “he wants to test me!” His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face. “Let him see whether I’m a coward,” he thought.::1995-03-24

Joyce::803237.1630262923::“We’ll see,” replied Rostov. “Karai, phweet!” he cried, answering his uncle’s words with this call. Karai was an ugly and whiskery old he-dog, famous for having gone alone against a seasoned wolf. Everybody took their places.::1862-09-05
Eagledale::41323.36253837365::“No, just look, what a moon!…Ah, how lovely! Come here. Darling, dear heart, come here. Well, you see? I’d like to sit on my heels, like this, take myself by the knees—tight, as tight as possible, you’ve got to strain—and fly away! Like this!”::1872-04-23
Port Ludlow::587930.3895367176::The under-officer, frowning and muttering some abuse, thrust his horse’s breast towards Balashov, took hold of his saber, and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking him if he was deaf and had not heard what he was told.

Desert Aire::738086.9217191356::“Ah, well, how about that! I got everything confused. There are so many relations in Moscow! You’re Boris…yes. So we’ve finally straightened it out.

Yoman::153932.4455618759::Rostov looked out the window and saw Denisov coming home. Denisov was a small man with a red face, shining black eyes, and disheveled black mustaches and hair.

He was approaching the porch gloomily, his head hanging.::1849-08-16
Cordell::793375.7156830007::The day after his visit to Count Arakcheev, Prince Andrei went to a soir233;e at Count Kochubey’s.

Oceanside::677322.432167885::“No, you know, I don’t believe we were in animals,” Natasha said in the same whisper, though the music had stopped. “I know for certain that we were angels somewhere, and visited here, and so we remember everything…”::1940-07-19
Santa Rosa::164295.83198431708::“Le Roi de Prusse!”  and, having said it, he began to laugh.

Boise::530326.4254986787::It was becoming frightening.

Hockinson::452478.9634975085::Going into the house, Prince Andrei saw Nesvitsky and another adjutant having something to eat.

Enetai::753217.7100184216::“With that I must observe, Your Excellency,” he went on, remembering Dolokhov’s conversation with Kutuzov and his own last encounter with the demoted soldier, “that the demoted private Dolokhov, before my eyes, took a French officer prisoner and particularly distinguished himself.”::1805-04-04
Clearview::885608.7049535544::After tea, Sonya saw a timorous maid waiting for her by Natasha’s door. She let her in and, eavesdropping at the door, learned that a letter had been brought again.::1943-04-04
Sahalee::509907.7582488222::“It is a disgrace for a soldier to steal, a soldier should be honest, noble, and brave; and if one steals from his comrade, there is no honor in him, he is a scoundrel. More, more!”::1970-01-08
Springfield::987719.3740298848::Late that night, when everyone had dispersed, Denisov, with his short hand, patted his favorite, Rostov, on the shoulder.::1990-01-19
Midway::123053.60494458284::“Yes,” said the countess, and she gave him her hand and pressed her lips to his forehead with a mixed feeling of alienation and tenderness when he bent over her hand. She wished to love him as a son; but she felt that for her he was an alien and frightening man.::1895-02-06
Corona::205036.58351249865::They waited dinner a long time that day for Natasha. She sat in her room and wept like a child, blowing her nose and sobbing. Sonya stood over her and kissed her hair.::1936-06-15
Eugene::693608.7242358912::The uncle led his guests through the front hall into a small reception room with a folding table and red chairs, then to a drawing room with a round birch table and a sofa, then to the study, with a torn sofa, a worn rug, and portraits of Suvorov, the host’s father and mother, and himself in military uniform. The study smelled strongly of tobacco and dogs.::1991-07-24
Fort Collins::346366.4803119868::“I can’t help loving the light, it’s not my fault. And I’m very happy. Do you understand me? I know you’re glad for me.”::1813-09-05
Peoria::8611.461735424042::“J’ai le plus vif d233;sir,” 233;crit le Roi de Prusse 224; Bonaparte, “que V. M. soit accueillie et trait233;e dans mon palais d’une mani232;re, qui lui soit agr233;able et c’est avec empressement, que j’ai pris 224; cet effet toutes les mesures que les circonstances me permettaient. Puisse-je avoir r233;ussi!” Les g233;n233;raux Prussiens se piquent de politesse envers les Fran231;ais et mettent bas les armes aux premi232;res sommations.::1868-02-15
Newport Hills::372317.1515251942::Pelageya Danilovna, having ordered a space cleared for the guests and snacks served to the masters and servants, not removing her spectacles, with a suppressed smile, walked among the mummers, looking closely at their faces and not recognizing anybody. She not only did not recognize the Rostovs or Dimmler, but she could not recognize her own daughters, or her husband’s robes and uniforms, which they were wearing.::2016-09-15
Upper Preston::221767.72417130152::“Loathsome woman!” the princess cried, suddenly falling upon Anna Mikhailovna and tearing the portfolio from her.::1838-03-24
Frisco::800377.3368686902::The red Lyubim overtook Milka, precipitously threw himself at the wolf, and seized him by the hindquarters, but in the same second became frightened and jumped over to the other side. The wolf crouched, clacked his teeth, got up again, and loped on, accompanied at two yards’ distance by all the dogs, who would not go nearer to him.::1906-10-01
Nordland::36150.07082485655::“Prince Vassily came to Moscow yesterday. He’s going to do some inspecting, I’m told,” said the guest.::1881-07-24
Tyler::64718.301708646344::But the countess did not consent to let the count go: he had had a pain in his leg all those days. It was decided that Ilya Andreich should not go, but that if Louisa Ivanovna (Mme Schoss) went, then the young ladies could go to Mrs. Melyukov’s. Sonya, always timid and shy, was the most insistent in begging Louisa Ivanovna not to refuse them.::1822-06-22
Camden::651690.7588752613::It was already dusk when Prince Andrei and Pierre drove up to the main entrance of the house at Bald Hills. As they were driving up, Prince Andrei, smiling, drew Pierre’s attention to the bustling that was going on by the back porch. A bent old woman with a bundle on her back and a short man dressed in black and with long hair, seeing the carriage drive up, went running back to the gate. Two women ran out after them, and all four, glancing at the carriage, ran fearfully up the back porch.::1961-03-15
Rockport::403985.51067916455::He opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of the night hung three feet above the light from the coals. A dust of falling snow flew through that light. Tushin did not return, the doctor did not come. He was alone, only some little soldier now sat naked on the other side of the fire, warming his thin, yellow body.::1884-01-24
Cary::64269.29283631566::Everything within him and around him seemed confused, senseless, and loathsome. But in this very loathing for everything around him, Pierre took a sort of irritating pleasure.::1912-05-17
Preston::81277.65567377977::“Tonight Schubert will be dining with us, a colonel in the Pavlogradsky hussar regiment. He’s been on leave here and is taking him along. What to do?” said the count, shrugging his shoulders and speaking jokingly about a matter that obviously cost him much grief.::1920-05-03
Lancaster::850741.5291080908::“I’ll kill you!” he shouted, and with a strength as yet unknown to him, he seized the marble slab from a table, took a step towards her, and swung.::1813-07-19
Rochester::598491.9936488916::Nikolai, his groom, the uncle, and his hunter all rode round and round the beast, hallooing, shouting, preparing to dismount at any moment, when the wolf sat on his haunches, and leaping forward each time the wolf shook himself and made a move towards the timber, which would save him.::1854-03-02
Hayward::307092.03760842205::“Wonderful!” said Natasha. “One could just fall in love with her!” At that moment the last chords of the overture sounded and the conductor tapped with his baton. The late-coming men went to their seats in the parterre and the curtain rose.::1878-08-21
Harbour Pointe::460509.7051295376::“Nowadays, in order to please Moscow girls, il faut 234;tre m233;lancolique. Et il est tr232;s m233;lancolique aupr232;s de mademoiselle Karagine, ”†364 said Pierre.::1878-08-05
Wellpinit::759026.2177740418::“What makes me? I don’t know. I have to. Besides, I’m going…” He paused. “I’m going because this life I lead here, this life—is not for me!”::1870-04-15
Glacier::444671.8396508145::“No, but I have fallen in love and will fall in love a thousand times, though I have no such feeling of friendship, trust, and love for anyone but you. Besides, I’m young. Maman  doesn’t want it. Well, simply, I don’t promise anything. And I ask you to think about Dolokhov’s proposal,” he said, speaking his friend’s name with difficulty.::1960-02-06
Palmdale::933846.1012006153::Ilya Andreevich was slightly flushed from the wine and the driving; his eyes, veiled with moisture, had a special glitter, and, wrapped in his fur coat, sitting in his saddle, he had the look of a child made ready to go for a walk.::1879-02-23
Eastsound::679963.7101419675::Prince Andrei, who evidently wanted to soften the awkwardness of Pierre’s speech, got up, intending to leave and making a sign to his wife.::1999-12-21
Central Park::497851.19158940605::Dolokhov gravely began to deal. Oh, how Rostov hated at that moment those reddish hands, with their short fingers and the hair sticking out from the cuffs, which had him in their power…He won the ten.::1970-11-03
Salinas::401034.53543174075::“Forgive me for troubling you…” Pierre realized that Prince Andrei wanted to talk about Natasha, and his broad face expressed regret and compassion. This expression of Pierre’s face angered Prince Andrei; he went on resolutely, in a ringing and unpleasant voice: “I have received a refusal from Countess Rostov, and rumors have reached me about her hand being sought by your brother-in-law, or something like that. Is it true?”::1845-01-25
Alexandria::387385.9290759639::When Natasha left the drawing room and ran off, she ran no further than the conservatory. In that room she stopped, listening to the talk in the drawing room and waiting for Boris to come out. She was already growing impatient and, stamping her little foot, was about to cry because he did not come at once, when she heard the neither slow nor quick, but proper footsteps of the young man. Natasha quickly darted among the tubs of plants and hid herself.::1999-04-25
Lakewood::948575.7092604369::“No one is right, no one is wrong, so she’s not wrong either,” he thought. If Pierre did not consent at once to a reunion with his wife, it was only because, being in a state of anguish, he was not able to undertake anything. If his wife had come to him, he would not have sent her away. Was it not all the same, compared to what preoccupied Pierre, whether he lived or did not live with his wife?::1929-12-01
Lake Shore::542599.8781822036::“It’s begun! Here it is!” thought Prince Andrei, feeling the blood beginning to rush more quickly to his heart. “But where, then? How will my Toulon declare itself?” he thought.::2014-03-24
Houghton::958827.9065143889::“I’ll come to one place and pray; before I have time to get used to it and love it, I’ll go on. And I’ll keep going until my legs give out, and I lie down and die somewhere, and come finally to that eternal, quiet haven, where there is no sorrow or sighing!…” thought Princess Marya.::1922-07-04
Lake Cavanaugh::48305.45413793685::The conversation ended with the count, who wished to be magnanimous and not be subjected to new requests, saying he would give him a promissory note for eighty thousand. Berg smiled meekly, kissed the count on the shoulder, and said that he was very grateful, but that he was quite unable to settle into the new life now without receiving thirty thousand in cash.::1845-11-21
Springfield::387686.64620019775::“I think the battle will be lost, and I said so to Count Tolstoy and asked him to convey it to the sovereign. And what do you think he replied? Eh, mon cher g233;n233;ral, je me m234;le de riz et des c244;telettes, m234;lez-vous des affaires de la guerre. †264 Yes…That was the answer I got!”::1895-06-17
Mineral::579207.7495104844::“One was knocked out,” the staff officer replied, “but I cannot understand about the other. I was there myself all the while and giving orders, and I had only just left…It was hot, to tell the truth,” he added modestly.::1880-01-06
Lake Stickney::143142.46315146505::“No, you know, this Anatole costs me forty thousand a year,” he said, obviously unable to restrain the melancholy course of his thoughts. He paused.::2003-01-13
Acme::711864.130901486::To the viscount, who was meeting him for the first time, it was clear that this Jacobin was not at all as frightening as his words. Everyone fell silent.::1978-06-09
Oyehut::12308.15426921239::“Well, well, all right!” said the old count. “He keeps getting heated up. It’s this Bonaparte who’s turned all their heads; they all wonder how it is that from the lieutenants he landed among the emperors. Well, God grant it,” he added, not noticing the guest’s mocking smile.::1914-10-20
Pasadena::874250.9897520626::At the sight of the letter, the princess’s face became covered with red blotches. She hastily took it and bent over it.::1830-07-22
Sunnyvale::434746.46110498096::Nikolai, who wanted to give everyone a ride over the excellent road in his troika, suggested that they take a dozen or so of the dressed-up servants and go to their uncle’s.::1983-04-09
Fobes Hill::969898.4288436414::“But do you take it without sugar?” she asked, with the same smile as if everything she said and everything the others said was very funny and had some other meaning.::1857-02-13
Rosario::257581.33261007577::“Quelle d233;licatesse!” *250 thought the princess. “Can Am233;lie” (that was Mlle Bourienne’s name) “really think I could be jealous of her and not appreciate her pure affection for and devotion to me?” She went over to Mlle Bourienne and kissed her warmly. Anatole went to kiss the little princess’s hand.::1942-04-21
Pomona::24973.52755594995::When Prince Andrei went into the study, the old prince, in his old man’s spectacles and his white smock, in which he received no one except his son, was sitting at the table and writing. He looked up.::1986-08-09
Fox Island::629077.9512526571::When an apple ripens and falls—what makes it fall? Is it that it is attracted to the ground, is it that the stem withers, is it that the sun has dried it up, that it has grown heavier, that the wind shakes it, that the boy standing underneath wants to eat it?::1814-12-07
Canyon Park::261016.80073006518::Just as Prince Andrei met Nesvitsky and Zherkov, the Austrian general Strauch, attached to Kutuzov’s staff to oversee the supplying of the Russian army, came from the other end of the corridor, along with the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the day before. The corridor was wide enough for the generals to pass the three officers unhindered, but Zherkov, pushing Nesvitsky aside with his hand, said in a breathless voice:::1946-02-19
Hollywood::974564.2007291153::Neither her father and mother, nor Sonya, nor Prince Andrei himself could have foreseen how parting with her fianc233; would affect Natasha. Flushed and agitated, her eyes dry, she wandered about the house that day, occupying herself with the most insignificant things, as if not understanding what awaited her. She did not cry when, at the moment of taking leave of her, he kissed her hand for the last time.::1803-06-24
High Rock::844329.1719965131::Just then two horsemen appeared on the road from town along which signalmen had been posted. They were an adjutant with a Cossack riding behind him.::1999-12-11
Kansas City::72400.58401160465::Hot lips pressed themselves to her lips, and at the same moment she felt herself released again, and heard the rustle of H233;l232;ne’s dress in the room and the sound of her footsteps. Natasha glanced at H233;l232;ne, then, red and trembling, gave him a fearfully questioning glance and went to the door.::1834-03-09
Erlands Point::786201.4283973875::“So you never noticed before how beautiful I am?” H233;l232;ne seemed to say. “You never noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a woman who could belong to anyone, even you,” said her gaze. And at that moment Pierre felt that H233;l232;ne not only could, but must be his wife, that it could not be otherwise.::1909-02-07
Escondido::293753.25276971207::“You see, Prince, we can’t rid ourselves of these folk,” said the staff officer, pointing to them. “The commanders neglect discipline. And here,” he pointed to a sutler’s tent, “they crowd in and sit. This morning I drove them all out: look, it’s full again. We must ride over, Prince, and scare them away. For a moment.”::1877-09-14
Gorst::237160.5456790209::It was the second night that the two of them had not slept, looking after the boy, who was burning with fever. For two whole days, not trusting their house doctor and expecting the one they had sent for from town, they had been trying now one, now another remedy. Worn out by sleeplessness and anxiety, they shifted their grief onto each other, reproached each other, and quarreled.::1894-05-24
Johnson::226235.83112998237::“There’ll be a report in it for you,” said Zherkov. “Just see if I don’t get promoted sublieutenant.”::1849-09-24
Alderton::44019.33577363048::“What’s there to look at?” said the assistant. But precisely because the assistant obviously did not want to let him go in, Rostov entered the soldiers’ wards. Here the stench, which he had managed to get used to in the corridor, was still stronger. The stench here was slightly different: it was sharper, and one could sense that it was coming precisely from here.::1867-06-15
Dusty::818289.2962054316::“Je voudrais voir le grand homme, ”*326 he said, referring to Napoleon, whom, until then, like everyone else, he had always called Buonaparte.::2004-11-11
Clarksville::672238.1434362181::“All this had to be so and could not be otherwise,” thought Pierre, “therefore there’s no point in asking whether it’s good or bad. It’s good because it’s definite, and there’s no more of the old tormenting doubt.” Pierre silently held his fianc233;e’s hand and looked at her beautiful breast rising and falling.::1949-10-21
Bay Center::407997.36775622284::But the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in the houses and fortifications looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon remained turned against each other just as before.::1823-02-18
Joliet::468939.01663779194::“Really, it’s all the same to me, all quite the same!” said Prince Andrei, beginning to realize that his news about the battle at Krems was indeed of little importance in view of such events as the occupation of the capital of Austria. “How is it that Vienna’s been taken? What about the bridge? And the famous t234;te de pont, §196 and Prince Auersperg? There was a rumor among us that Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna,” he said.::1935-08-14
Mazama::297084.3334639516::“All right,” said Dolokhov, having finished reckoning, “all right! I’ll go twenty-one roubles,” he said, pointing to the difference of twenty-one roubles over the exact sum of forty-three thousand, and, taking the deck, prepared to deal. Rostov obediently unbent the corner and, instead of the six thousand he had prepared, carefully wrote twenty-one.::1978-05-15
Selleck::61709.79057135917::“Wouldn’t you be a nimble one, Zikin, if they set you on a horse,” a corporal joked to a thin little soldier bent under a heavy pack.::1822-06-21
Amanda Park::78104.02377742287::“One more question, Count,” he said, “which I ask you to answer not as a future Mason, but as an honest man (galant homme),  in all sincerity: have you renounced your former convictions, do you believe in God?”::1997-11-02
Rockford::873577.0635799107::“How, then? With all your mass you fell upon the unfortunate Mortier with his one division, and this Mortier slips between your fingers? Where’s the victory?”::1843-10-20
Sunnydale::153638.4977695695::On coming home in the evening, he would jot down in his notebook four or five necessary visits or rendez-vous  at appointed hours. The mechanism of life, the ordering of the day so as to get everywhere on time, took the greater part of the very energy of life. He did not do anything, he did not even think about anything and had no time to think, but only talked, and talked successfully, about what he had had time to think over previously in the country.::1980-04-01
Van Zandt::457847.8847273528::And with a contemptuous sigh, he again changed position. At these words, Prince Ippolit, who had long been gazing at the viscount through his lorgnette, suddenly turned his whole body to the little princess and, asking her for a needle, began showing her the coat of arms of the Cond233;s,16 drawing with the needle on the table. He explained this coat of arms to her with a significant air, as if the princess had asked him about it.::1882-04-16
McDonald::902861.5715400211::“Mon cher, si vous vous conduisez ici, comme 224; P233;tersburg, vous finirez tr232;s mal; c’est tout ce je vous dis. *105 The count is very, very ill: you must not see him at all.”::1850-03-13
Moclips::957550.7887550183::Pierre, too, following her, almost ran out to the front hall, holding back the tears of tenderness and happiness that choked him, put on his coat, missing the sleeves, and got into the sleigh.::1905-06-19
Ocean Park::420596.8771500246::“But I precisely wish to tell you, so as to avoid misunderstandings, that you are greatly mistaken if you count my mother and me among those people. We’re very poor, but I can speak for myself at least: precisely because your father is rich, I don’t consider myself his relation, and neither I nor my mother will ever ask for or accept anything from him.”::1903-01-16
West Valley::7671.213237675279::What produced this extraordinary event? What were its causes? Historians say with na239;ve assurance that the causes of this event were the offense inflicted upon the duke of Oldenburg, the non-observance of the Continental System,1 Napoleon’s love of power, Alexander’s firmness, diplomatic mistakes, and so on.::2019-12-24
Thompson Place::527024.4832926239::“I’m waiting, Your Majesty,” Kutuzov repeated (Prince Andrei noticed that Kutuzov’s upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said this “waiting”). “Not all the columns are assembled, Your Majesty.”::1831-12-14
Dungeness::40043.91686358366::I go to bed in a happy and calm mood. Great Lord, help me to walk in Thy ways: (1) to overcome the part of wrath by gentleness and slowness; (2) of lust by restraint and repulsion; (3) to withdraw from vanity, yet not lose the habit of (a) work in government service, (b) family cares, (c) friendly relations, and(d) economic concerns.::2005-07-23
Birch Bay::890008.1760149787::“Don’t cry, mama, only tell me that you want it, and you know I’ll give my whole life, everything, for you to be at peace,” said Nikolai. “I’ll sacrifice everything for you, even my feeling.”::1976-11-16
Stratford::901542.7632431472::There are two sides to each man’s life: his personal life, which is the more free the more abstract its interests, and his elemental, swarmlike life, where man inevitably fulfills the laws prescribed for him.::1812-11-01
Torrance::988002.7447489725::Boris stopped in the middle of the room, looking around, brushed some specks of dust off the sleeve of his uniform with his hand, and went up to a mirror, studying his handsome face. Natasha kept still, peeking from her ambush, waiting to see what he would do. He stood for some time before the mirror, smiled, and walked to the other door. Natasha was about to call him, but then changed her mind.::1857-07-21
Naperville::325064.3888218737::And the regimental commander, reflected as in a mirror, invisibly to himself, in the hussar officer, bounced, came forward, and replied:::1879-11-17
Barberton::76438.42059658578::The entire suite now drew back, and Rostov saw the general speak about something with the sovereign for a rather long time.::1807-08-10
Paterson::515942.9204324971::“For them everything’s the same. They don’t know anything! What am I to do with myself?” thought Nikolai, and he went back to the reception room, where the clavichord stood.::2005-03-14
Savannah::178200.45504284932::“I loved you all and did nothing bad to anybody, and what have you done to me? Ah, what have you done to me?” said her lovely, pitiful, dead face. In the corner, something small and red snorted and squealed in Marya Bogdanovna’s white, trembling hands.::1930-10-03
Almota::498411.9850608598::Sonya, brushing off feathers, and hiding the verses in her bosom, near her neck with its protruding collarbones, her face flushed, went running after Natasha with light, merry steps down the corridor to the sitting room. At the request of the guests, the young people sang the quartet “The Spring,” which everyone liked very much. Then Nikolai sang a song he had just learned:38::1818-03-04
Skamokawa::515884.94144907757::Ilyin took a bucket of water and, pouring a drop of rum into it, came to Marya Genrikhovna, asking her to stir it with her finger.::1984-07-04
Bridgeport::145580.25104503025::“Your cockiness is dear to you, you don’t feel like apologizing,” the staff captain went on, “but for us old-timers, since we’ve grown up and, God willing, will die serving in the regiment, the honor of the regiment is dear to us, and Bogdanych knows it. Oh, how dear it is! And this is not good, not good. Whether it offends you or not, I always speak the plain truth. It’s not good!”::1962-02-02
Swinomish Village::558765.563404502::“Gone? Well, that’s good!” he said, gave the unconscious little princess an angry look, shook his head reproachfully, and slammed the door.::1947-01-10
Methow::175356.10149797253::“Natalie?!” his voice whispered questioningly, and someone squeezed her hands painfully. “Natalie?!”::1918-02-10
Bay View::888629.3499189935::“What can I tell you?” said the prince, in a cold, bored tone. “Qu’a-t-on d233;cid233;? On a d233;cid233; que Buonaparte a br251;l233; ses vaisseaux, et je crois que nous sommes en train de br251;ler les n244;tres. ”§8::1882-03-04
Newaukum::926166.2952921881::The day after his visit to Count Arakcheev, Prince Andrei went to a soir233;e at Count Kochubey’s.

Smyrna::862426.1993193914::The next morning Marya Dmitrievna took the girls to the Iverskaya Chapel and to Mme Aubert-Chalmet, who was so afraid of Marya Dmitrievna that she always let her have dresses for less, so as to get rid of her quickly. Marya Dmitrievna ordered almost the whole trousseau. On coming home, she drove everyone but Natasha out of the room and called her favorite to her armchair.::1869-08-16
Carlton::504376.7308672651::“How will it be in five years, if it goes on like this? Voil224; l’avantage d’234;tre p232;re. §21 Is she rich, this princess of yours?”::1884-04-07
Monitor::827591.7157515804::Old Prince Nikolai Andreich Bolkonsky received a letter from Prince Vassily in December 1805, informing him of his arrival together with his son. (“I am going to an inspection, and, of course, for me seventy miles is no detour if I can visit you, my much-esteemed benefactor,” he wrote, “and my Anatole is keeping me company on his way to the army; and I hope you will allow him personally to express the deep respect which he, in imitation of his father, has for you.”)::1806-09-03
Murfreesboro::717376.1262479678::Having gone less than half a mile at the tail of the column, he stopped by a solitary, deserted house (probably a former tavern), where the road forked. Both roads went down the hill, and troops were marching along both.::1849-05-11
Carlisle::565779.5304447858::“How do you mean, what the devil is a letter?” said Boris, picking it up and reading the address. “You need this letter very much.”::1840-08-08
Gainesville::566765.1441836577::Here Prince Ippolit snorted and guffawed, far in advance of his listeners, which produced an impression unfavorable to the narrator. Many smiled, however, the elderly lady and Anna Pavlovna among them.::2000-12-10
Breidablick::646306.1833109846::“J’ai le plus vif d233;sir,” 233;crit le Roi de Prusse 224; Bonaparte, “que V.

Cedar Rapids::80333.04473665981::“Mon cher,”  said Kochubey, “even in this matter you cannot avoid Mikhail Mikhailovich. C’est le grand faiseur. *337 I’ll tell him. He promised to come this evening…”::1805-12-11
Visalia::939784.5691562571::“Hurrah! Let’s go quick, Rostov. I found it! A tavern, about two hundred paces from here, our boys are already there. We can dry out, and Marya Genrikhovna’s there.”::1978-05-05
Parkland::163693.22046090974::“Dolokhov, Marya Ivanovna’s son,” she said in a mysterious whisper, “they say he has totally compromised her. He introduced him, invited him to his house in Petersburg, and now…She has come here, and that daredevil after her,” said Anna Mikhailovna, wishing to express her sympathy for Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half smile expressing her sympathy for the daredevil, as she called Dolokhov. “They say Pierre is totally crushed by his grief.”::1908-08-23
Veradale::96169.218060278::“Yesterday my brother dined with me—we died of laughter—he eats nothing and sighs after you, my lovely. Il est fou, mais fou amoureux de vous, ma ch232;re. ”*381::1996-08-07
Kummer::579914.9608013114::“Tomorrow we’re off, I’m giving you a place in my carriage. I’m very glad. We’ve finished everything that matters here. I should have left long ago. I have received this from the chancellor. I solicited him on your behalf, and you’ve been enrolled in the diplomatic corps and made a gentleman of the bedchamber. Now the diplomatic path is open to you.”::1852-12-21
Coral Springs::610265.9771719957::“A whole ye-e-ear!” Natasha said suddenly, only now understanding that the wedding was to be postponed for a year. “But why a year? Why a year?…” Prince Andrei began to explain to her the reasons for this postponement. Natasha did not listen to him.::1823-01-21
New Haven::973497.466512603::The curtain rose again. Anatole left the box calm and cheerful. Natasha returned to her father’s box, now totally subjected to the world she was in. Everything that was happening before her now seemed perfectly natural to her; but instead all her former thoughts about her fianc233;, about Princess Marya, about country life, never once entered her head, as if it was all long ago, long past.::1880-09-19
Boyds::659038.2064904352::“Go onto the ice! Go onto the ice! Go! Turn off! Don’t you hear? Go!” cried countless voices after the cannonball hit the general, themselves not knowing what and why they were shouting.::1817-07-07
Stamford::307688.98980746994::A solemn session of the lodge of the second degree was convened, at which Pierre promised to tell what he had to convey to the Petersburg brothers from the highest leaders of the order. The session was full. After the usual rituals, Pierre got up and began his speech.::1848-07-10
Thousand Oaks::402860.34547706053::“I’ve come to sit with you, Mashenka,” said the nanny, “and here I’ve brought the prince’s wedding candles15 to light before the saint, my angel,” she said, sighing.::1927-04-14

Porter::498502.3733069636::“Since the adversaries have refused a reconciliation, kindly begin: take your pistols and at the word three start walking towards each other.”::1914-06-07
Lisabeula::992505.4980104006::Evidently something suddenly changed in the princess’s mind; her thin lips turned pale (her eyes remained the same), and her voice, when she began to speak, kept breaking into such tremors as she evidently did not expect herself.::1851-07-21
Concord::457257.6575079622::“If I’d seen her before as she is now,” thought Nikolai, “I’d have asked her long ago what I should do, and I’d have done whatever she told me, and everything would be right.”::2000-07-07
Elizabeth::901377.0681544439::“What am I to do?” he said finally. “You know, I did all a father could for their upbringing, and they both turned out des imb233;ciles.  Ippolit is at least an untroublesome fool, but Anatole is a troublesome one. That’s the only difference,” he said, smiling more unnaturally and animatedly than usual, and with that showing especially clearly in the wrinkles that formed around his mouth something unexpectedly coarse and disagreeable.::1969-04-03
Lafayette::9500.54701517533::“Don’t come in,” she said to the old count, who was following her, “later,” she said, and closed the door behind her.::1959-05-08
Custer::240735.55622444442::“You do know her husband?” said Anna Pavlovna, closing her eyes and pointing to H233;l232;ne with a sad gesture. “Ah, she’s such an unhappy and lovely woman! Don’t speak of him in her presence, please don’t speak of him. It’s too painful for her!”::1919-06-16
Orcas::773150.2436808832::“You, my dear countess, are a notorious spendthrift,” said the count, and, kissing his wife’s hand, he went back to his study.::1984-11-24
Diablo::505593.2863159831::“Ah! Rostov! Greetings, greetings!” he shouted, in the same voice he used in the regiment; but Rostov noticed sadly that, behind this habitual casualness and liveliness, some new, bad, hidden feeling showed in the expression of Denisov’s face, in his intonations and words.::1842-02-03
Christopher::519322.57020609896::“Ah, no, not at all, on the contrary, I’m very glad to make your acquaintance,” said Pierre, and, glancing once again at his new acquaintance’s hands, he took a closer look at his ring. He saw a death’s head on it, a Masonic sign.::1997-05-07
Midvale Corner::25660.186435546904::“Count!…don’t ruin…a young man…here’s this wretched…money, take it…” He threw it on the table. “I have an old father, a mother!…”::1818-08-18

Topeka::956459.5195938585::“Well, well, all right!” said the old count. “He keeps getting heated up. It’s this Bonaparte who’s turned all their heads; they all wonder how it is that from the lieutenants he landed among the emperors. Well, God grant it,” he added, not noticing the guest’s mocking smile.::2000-04-13
Simi Valley::613383.3461985379::Pierre felt embarrassed and wanted to avoid that gaze, but the old man’s glittering eyes drew him irresistibly to them.::1981-10-14
Three Lakes::892781.459111285::“How many times have I asked you not to take my things,” she said. “You have a room of your own.” She took the inkstand from Nikolai.::1956-09-08
Kendall::458306.04383273446::“There is still much before us, much of everything,” he said, with an old man’s perceptive expression, as though he understood everything that was going on in Bolkonsky’s soul. “If one tenth of his detachment comes back tomorrow, I’ll thank God,” Kutuzov added, as if speaking to himself.::1912-06-17
Kanaskat::310587.723713769::“Well,” he said, turning to his wife, and this “well” sounded like cold mockery, as if he had said: “Now perform your tricks.”::1856-04-25
Santa Clara::525232.3006255344::“Not only occupied, but Bonaparte is in Sch246;nbrunn, and the count, our dear Count Vrbna, is going to him for orders.”9::1952-11-19
Athens::622728.4576560062::Dolokhov remained by the gate. Anatole followed the maid into the yard, turned the corner, and ran up to the porch.::1874-04-02
Nile::429908.53526180383::“Soon now? Soon now? Oh, these unbearable streets, shops, bakeries, street lamps, cabbies!” thought Rostov, when they had already registered their leaves at the city gates and entered Moscow.::1956-12-22
Alderwood Manor::405313.2023902506::Pierre was sitting in the drawing room, where Shinshin, knowing he had come from abroad, had started a boring political conversation with him, in which other people joined. When the music began to play, Natasha came into the drawing room and, going straight up to Pierre, blushing and with laughing eyes, said:::1909-05-10
Clarkston Heights::307066.7737466221::Prince Andrei remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being put on the stretcher, the jolting while he was being carried, and the probing of his wound at the first-aid station. He came to only at the end of the day, when he, along with other Russian wounded and captured officers, was taken to the hospital. During this transfer, he felt somewhat fresher and could look around and even speak.::1980-01-09
Pacific Beach::705154.8211308675::“Why no, not in the least,” said Boris. “But if you’re tired, let’s go to my room, and you can lie down to rest.”::1895-09-16
Hartford::192906.9339451118::“To enter Russia without a declaration of war. I will make peace only when not a single armed enemy remains on my soil,” he said. It seemed to Boris that the sovereign enjoyed uttering these words: he was pleased with the form in which he had expressed his thought, but displeased that Boris had overheard it.::2011-01-16
Victorville::436280.40653424227::Prince Pyotr Mikhailovich Volkonsky occupied a post as something like the sovereign’s chief of staff. Volkonsky came out of the study and, bringing maps to the drawing room and spreading them on the table, told the assembled gentlemen the questions on which he would like to hear their opinion. The thing was that during the night information had been received (subsequently proved false) that the French were moving to outflank the Drissa camp.::1945-06-01
Abilene::467020.51171451045::“Schon fleissig!” †183 said Rostov, still with the same joyful, brotherly smile, which never left his animated face. “Hoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen! Kaiser Alexander hoch!” ‡184 he addressed the German, repeating words often spoken by the landlord.::1809-12-07
Chimacum::208262.93602545897::“And then some!” shouted Denisov. “Good work, lads! And it was a rotten job! Attacking’s a lovely thing, cut ’em to pieces, but here, devil knows, it’s more like target practice.”::2002-06-21
Naselle::913015.4424257175::With great effort he reached his horse. Shouting constantly, he began to move ahead. The soldiers pressed back to let him pass, then pressed together again so hard that his leg was squashed, and those closest to him were not to blame, for they were pressed still harder.::1809-04-10
Grotto::679229.4261169576::“I asked papa and mama about that blackamoor,” said Natasha. “They say there wasn’t any blackamoor. But you do remember!”::2019-12-21
Norman::658189.8703478667::“Bonsoir, Lise,” *76 said Prince Andrei, standing up and kissing her hand politely, as if she were a stranger.::1831-03-21
Vallejo::848794.3673107858::But before he finished saying it, Prince Andrei, feeling sobs of shame and anger rising in his throat, was already jumping off his horse and running towards the standard.::1903-12-14
Pine City::453390.92450009764::It was already the beginning of June when Prince Andrei, on his way home, drove again into that birch woods, where that gnarled old oak had struck him so strangely and memorably. The ringing of the harness bells was still more muffled in the woods than a month ago; everything was filled out, shady, and dense; and the young firs scattered through the woods did not disrupt the overall beauty and, imitating the general character, showed the tender green of their fluffy young shoots.::1830-02-07
Berkeley::220663.52161652726::“Comme c’est un homme d’esprit, votre p232;re,”  she said, “c’est 224; cause de cela peut-234;tre qu’il me fait peur.” ‡169::1800-09-24

Ann Arbor::969237.5172404916::“Les souverains? Je ne parle pas de la Russie,”  the viscount said courteously and hopelessly. “Les souverains, madame? Qu’ont-ils fait pour Louis XVI, pour la reine, pour madame Elisabeth? 15 Rien,”  he continued, growing animated. “Et croyez-moi, ils subissent la punition pour leur trahison de la cause des Bourbons. Les souverains? Ils envoient des ambassadeurs complimenter l’usurpateur.” †52::1968-02-07
Fargo::316262.5241141398::On the French side, among those groups where the guns were, a puff of smoke appeared, a second, a third almost simultaneously, and just as the sound of the first shot reached them, a fourth appeared. Two sounds one after another, and a third.::1924-06-04
Belmont::816126.7041695944::Pierre felt that he was the center of everything, and this position delighted and embarrassed him. He found himself in the state of a man immersed in some occupation. He neither saw, nor understood, nor heard anything clearly. Only rarely, unexpectedly, did fragmentary thoughts and impressions of reality flash in his soul.::1913-03-04
Columbia::319617.5290142246::Boris smiled cautiously, so that his smile could be understood either as mockery or as approval of the joke, depending on how it was received. Everyone laughed.::1946-08-22
Allentown::855030.4436805651::“Dismiss an old man to his country estates, who is left disgraced as it is that he cannot fulfill the great and glorious destiny for which he was chosen. I shall await your most merciful permission here in the hospital, to avoid playing the role of a scrivener  rather than a commander  of troops. My removal from the army will cause no greater stir than if a blind man was leaving it. There are thousands like me in Russia.”::1833-11-22
Seabeck::879743.745504702::The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the fat staff officer, at Zherkov, and frowned.::2000-12-22
Evansville::619779.664512702::“God be with us!” Bagration said in a firm, audible voice, turned for a moment to the front line, and, swinging his arms slightly, with the awkward gait of a cavalryman, as if working at it, he went forward over the uneven field. Prince Andrei felt that some invincible force was drawing him forward, and he experienced great happiness.*223::1803-12-23
Beaumont::358339.62152418256::“Nikolenka, what’s the matter with you?” asked Sonya’s eyes, turned to him. She saw at once that something had happened to him.::1893-05-08
Otis Orchards::613592.0042744826::But just then Berg came up to Pierre, insistently begging him to take part in an argument between the general and the colonel about Spanish affairs.::1998-06-20
Odessa::932240.2288623163::“See where God granted us to meet again,” said the small man. “Tushin, Tushin—remember, I gave you a ride at Sch246;ngraben? I’ve had a bit cut off, see…” he said, smiling and showing the empty sleeve of the robe. “It’s Vassily Dmitrich Denisov you’re looking for? He’s my roommate,” he said, on learning who Rostov wanted. “This way, this way.” And Tushin led him to the other room, from which came the loud laughter of several voices.::1848-09-18
West Pasco::535474.9037508412::When Boris and Anna Pavlovna returned to the general circle, the conversation there had been taken over by Prince Ippolit. Leaning forward in his armchair, he said:::1804-07-16
Badger::55052.47730013762::“Enough, enough, what’s wrong?” frightened voices whispered. Dolokhov looked at Pierre with his light, merry, cruel eyes, and with the same smile, as if saying: “Ah, this is what I like.”::1905-11-03
Wilmington::841005.9518199904::“It would have been hard to get through, Your Excellency,” the steward added. “So we’ve heard, Your Excellency, that a minister is going to be visiting Your Excellency?”::1964-04-25
Ravensdale::897859.7887735184::“Here’s how,” Nikolai replied. “You told me it depends on me. I don’t like Anna Mikhailovna, and I don’t like Boris, but they’ve been our friends and they’re poor. So here’s how!” and he tore up the note, and this action caused the old countess to burst into tears of joy. After that the young Rostov, not entering into such business anymore, with passionate enthusiasm took up the occupation, new for him, of hunting with dogs, which the old count managed on a grand scale.::1821-08-09
Rollingbay::836618.3315719868::“No, it’s a chorus from The Water-Carrier, 8 don’t you hear?” And Natasha finished singing the chorus to give Sonya the idea.::1962-04-15
Rocky Point::773258.0460537752::“That is just why I do not begin, Sire,” Kutuzov said in a ringing voice, as if to forestall the possibility of not being heard, and again something twitched in his face. “I do not begin, Sire, because we are not on parade and not on the Tsaritsyn Field,” he uttered clearly and distinctly.::1938-11-16
Garrett::959351.6314491434::“Whatever misfortune there may be,” Prince Andrei went on, “I beg you, Mademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, turn to him alone for advice and help. He’s the most absentminded and ridiculous man, but he has a heart of gold.”::1883-06-21
Grayland::126589.44050270559::The two girls in white dresses, with identical roses in their dark hair, curtsied identically, but the hostess involuntarily rested her gaze longer on the slender Natasha. She looked at her and smiled at her alone with a special smile, in addition to her hostess smile. Gazing at her, the hostess may have remembered the golden, irretrievable time of her girlhood, and her own first ball. The host also followed Natasha with his eyes and asked the count which one was his daughter.::1938-03-02
Gilberton::748894.0049471257::Some forty uhlans drowned in the river, despite the boats that were sent to help. Most of the men were washed back to this side. The colonel and several other men crossed the river and barely managed to climb out on the bank. But as soon as they climbed out, their streaming wet clothes sticking to them, they shouted “Vivat!” —gazing rapturously at the spot where Napoleon had stood, but where he no longer was, and at that moment they considered themselves happy.::1953-05-15
Withrow::354031.5031683229::“My darling!” he spoke words he had never said to her before. “God is merciful…” She looked at him questioningly with childlike reproach.::1923-07-21
Arvada::106068.78703089351::Rostov staked five roubles and lost, staked once more and lost again. Dolokhov “killed”—that is, won—ten cards in a row from Rostov.::1989-09-07
Sudden Valley::663212.735480869::“Mais charmante!” *374 he said, evidently about Natasha, as she did not so much hear as understand from the movement of his lips. Then he walked to the front row and sat down next to Dolokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and casual way that same Dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He smiled at him with a merry wink and rested his foot against the rail.::1986-01-16
Meridian::387275.4446952745::“Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen…” she said, counting on her thin little fingers. “All right! So it’s settled?”::2017-11-10
Aberdeen Gardens::743594.3052519062::“Come over here, ch232;re  H233;l232;ne,” Anna Pavlovna said to the beautiful princess, who was sitting some way off, forming the center of another circle.::1921-01-06
Possession::824959.3749614037::“Ah, Bondarenko, friend of my heart,” he said to the hussar who came rushing for his horse. “Give him a cooling down, my friend,” he said with that merry brotherly tenderness with which all fine young men treat everyone when they are happy.::1955-05-09
Independence::267585.5173405357::But then, seeing her father and especially little Coco, her intention would weaken, she would weep in quiet and feel she was a sinful woman: she loved her father and her nephew more than God.::1886-04-24
Bickleton::91181.87682641343::It was becoming frightening. It was obvious that the affair, having begun so lightly, could no longer be prevented by anything, that it was going on by itself, independently of men’s will, and would be accomplished. Denisov first went to the barrier and announced:::1987-05-12
Provo::289038.82633518893::The Englishman nodded his head, in no way making clear whether he did or did not accept this new bet. Anatole did not let go of the Englishman, and though he had nodded to show he had understood everything, Anatole translated Dolokhov’s words into English for him. A young, lean boy, a life-hussar, who had gambled away everything that evening, climbed up on the window, stuck his head out, and looked down.::1918-02-19
Doty::162840.4817461695::The campaign began, the regiment was moved to Poland, the pay was doubled, new officers arrived, new men and horses, and above all that excitedly cheerful mood spread around which accompanies the beginning of war; and Rostov, conscious of his advantageous position in the regiment, gave himself up wholly to the pleasures and interests of military service, though he knew that sooner or later he would have to leave them behind.::1841-11-06
Lansing::541773.4894635007::But in spite of that, Natasha, now excited, now frightened, her eyes staring, lay for a long time in her mother’s bed that evening. She told her how he had praised her, then how he had said he would be going abroad, then had asked where they would spend the summer, then how he had asked her about Boris.::1838-11-06
Newman Lake::195169.9574393746::“Well, Sonya,” she said, and went out to the very middle of the reception room, where, in her opinion, the resonance was best. Raising her head, lowering her lifelessly hanging arms as dancers do, Natasha made a few energetic steps from heel to toe in the middle of the room and stopped.::1936-02-03
Freeland::747225.2207902222::As her animation increased, the prince looked at her more and more sternly, and suddenly, as if he had studied her enough and arrived at a clear idea of her, turned away and addressed Mikhail Ivanovich.::1893-12-25
Indianola::786731.1468639422::“Hurrah! Let’s go quick, Rostov. I found it! A tavern, about two hundred paces from here, our boys are already there. We can dry out, and Marya Genrikhovna’s there.”::1814-08-19
Cowiche::169766.28953438555::The princess said nothing. All that could be heard were the sounds of the efforts of the struggle over the portfolio. It was clear that if she did start to talk, it would not be flattering for Anna Mikhailovna. Anna Mikhailovna held on tight, but in spite of that her voice retained all its sweet, drawling softness.::1989-03-20
Husum::473490.5888736136::Prince Andrei arrived at the quarters of General Bennigsen, who occupied a small manor house right on the bank of the river. Neither Bennigsen nor the sovereign was there; but Chernyshov, the imperial adjutant, received Bolkonsky and announced to him that the sovereign had ridden with General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci to make a second round of the fortifications of the Drissa camp, the suitability of which had become a subject of strong doubts.::1969-01-07

Pierre found it unpleasant to get into conversation with this old man, but, involuntarily submitting to him, he went over and sat down next to him.::1936-05-16
Lamona::96894.91718035725::“Good-bye, dear heart—it’s always like a harp, listening to him!” said the old prince, holding him by the hand and offering him his cheek for a kiss. The others got up along with Rastopchin.::1852-07-14
Skokomish::362167.26739218476::Natasha left off only when they told her there would be pineapple ice cream. Before the ice cream, champagne was served. The music struck up again, the count kissed his dear countess, and the guests, rising, wished the countess a happy name day, and clinked glasses across the table with the count, the children, and each other. Again the waiters scurried about, chairs scraped, and the guests, in the same order but with redder faces, returned to the drawing room and the count’s study.::2010-03-11
Vaughn::933607.2231651403::Lavrushka rummaged through the whole bed, looked under it, looked under the table, rummaged about everywhere, and stopped in the middle of the room.

Ruby::439734.40682913066::“That’s terrible! No, it’s terrible, terrible!” Natasha said suddenly and sobbed again. “I’ll die, waiting a year: it’s impossible, it’s terrible!” She looked into her fianc233;’s face and saw there an expression of compassion and bewilderment.::1955-08-17
Bryant::261940.84634577742::“Well, what do you want, then? You’re all in love these days. Well, if you’re in love, marry him,” the countess said, laughing crossly. “God help you!”::1908-03-03

El Monte::467250.1924087226::All of Pierre’s cheerfulness vanished. He asked the princess worried questions, begged her to tell him everything, to confide her grief to him; but she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said, that she did not remember what she had said, that she had no grief except the one he knew—that Prince Andrei’s marriage threatened to make father and son quarrel.::1845-12-21
Brady::161008.8727381781::“It’s obvious all you women are crybabies,” said Petya, pacing the room in big, resolute strides. “I’m very glad, really very glad, that my brother has distinguished himself. You’re all blubberers! You understand nothing.”::1922-12-16

North Lynnwood::506533.92494143214::“I’ll stop by those nuns, really,” he said to the officers, who were looking at him smilingly, and rode down the hill along a winding path.::2009-12-10
Cedar Falls::697188.5765022254::They had not seen each other for nearly half a year; and at their age, when young men take their first steps on life’s path, they both found enormous changes in each other, totally new reflections of the society in which they had taken their first steps in life. Both had changed greatly since their last meeting, and both wanted the sooner to show each other the changes that had taken place in them.::1888-12-25
Fairfield::736417.1670880023::“Natalie, un mot, un seul,”  he kept repeating, apparently not knowing what to say, and he repeated it until H233;l232;ne came up to them.::1823-09-23
Clearwater::29487.665782732987::Boris smiled almost imperceptibly, listening to his mother. He laughed meekly at her simple-hearted slyness, but he listened to her and occasionally questioned her attentively about the Penza and Nizhni Novgorod estates.::1829-06-19

Olalla::571706.7904448683::Balashov, feeling it necessary to object, said that on the Russian side things did not look so gloomy. Napoleon said nothing, went on looking at him mockingly, and obviously was not listening to him. Balashov said that in Russia all sorts of good things were expected from the war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to say: “I know it’s your duty to say so, but you don’t believe it yourself, I have persuaded you.”::1822-02-01
Basin City::117938.89600980068::“Nonsense, sit down, drink,” said Anatole, and he poured him a big glass of Madeira. The coachman’s eyes lit up at the sight of the wine. He declined out of propriety, then drank and wiped his mouth with a red silk handkerchief tucked inside his hat.::2005-12-01

Right, right? very noble? right?” Natasha asked so earnestly and excitedly that it was clear that what she was saying now, she had said before through tears. Rostov pondered.::1880-04-20
West Jordan::350550.73255816504::As always happens with lonely women who have long lived without the society of men, on Anatole’s appearance all three women in Prince Nikolai Andreevich’s house felt equally that their life had not been life until that moment. The power of thought, feeling, observation instantly increased tenfold in them, as if their life, going on in darkness till then, was suddenly lit up by a new light filled with meaning.::1987-08-24

Sappho::686829.6218151115::Nesvitsky was there as an old member of the club. Pierre, who, on his wife’s orders, had let his hair grow long and removed his spectacles, was fashionably dressed, but walked about the rooms with a sad and dejected air. As everywhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of people who bowed before his wealth, and he treated them with a habitual lordliness and absentminded disdain.::1968-12-16
Hunters::264839.1217938488::Boris stopped in the middle of the room, looking around, brushed some specks of dust off the sleeve of his uniform with his hand, and went up to a mirror, studying his handsome face.

Downey::838945.1629956771::Having read the letter, Natasha sat down at the desk to write a reply. “Ch232;re Princesse!”  she wrote quickly and mechanically, and stopped. What could she write after all that had happened yesterday? “Yes, yes, all that was, and now it’s all different,” she thought, sitting over the started letter. “Must I refuse him? Must I really? It’s terrible!…” And, so as not to think those dreadful thoughts, she went to Sonya and began sorting out patterns with her.::1850-02-08
Torboy::129837.93698502665::The squadron crossed the bridge and moved out of the range of fire without losing a single man. After them the second squadron, forming a line, also crossed, and the last Cossacks cleared off from that side.::1859-12-01

College Station::334682.75245972147::“One was knocked out,” the staff officer replied, “but I cannot understand about the other. I was there myself all the while and giving orders, and I had only just left…It was hot, to tell the truth,” he added modestly.::1851-06-02
Picnic Point::39814.34198116551::“I know no one can help if nature doesn’t help,” Prince Andrei said, visibly embarrassed. “I agree that only one case in a million ends badly, but it’s her and my fantasy. People have said things to her, she’s had dreams, and she’s afraid.”::1844-12-20
Aeneas::695572.1077688939::The magnificent reception room was filled. Everyone rose deferentially when the commander in chief, having spent about half an hour alone with the sick man, came out, responding slightly to the bows and trying to go quickly past the looks that doctors, clergymen, and relations directed at him.

Cedarhurst::592252.5777731092::“Yes, if you put the question that way, it’s another matter,” said Prince Andrei. “I build a house and cultivate a garden, and you build hospitals. Both can serve to pass the time. But what’s right, what’s good—that is for the one who knows all to judge, not for us.

Wheeler::158612.39041002528::“Well, well, all right!” said the old count. “He keeps getting heated up.

Lebam::890301.9704298704::There was a thaw, mud, cold, the ice on the river broke up, the roads became impassable; for several days provisions had not been issued either to the horses or to the men.

Marrowstone::811187.6576297928::Sonya walked wrapped in her fur coat. She was two steps away before she saw him; she also saw him not as she had known him and had always been a little afraid of him.

High Point::862531.6586395052::In the bottom, where the action began, the fog was still thick; up above it had cleared, but nothing of what was happening ahead could be seen.

I beg you, Natalie,” he suddenly said earnestly, “I’m going away. God knows what may happen. You may stop lov…Well, I know I mustn’t talk about that. One thing—whatever happens with you while I’m not here…”::2011-06-05
Fords Prairie::82443.62243661763::In other conversations she praised Julie and advised Nikolai to go to Moscow for the holidays to amuse himself. Nikolai guessed what his mother’s conversations were driving at, and during one of these conversations he got her to speak quite openly. She told him that all her hope for straightening out their affairs now lay in his marrying Miss Karagin.::1874-09-08
Carson::677800.4730860656::“Ils sont arriv233;s, Marie, *239 do you know?” said the little princess, waddling in with her belly and lowering herself heavily into an armchair.::1960-08-23
Mount Vista::148765.14829023747::Having gone past the guards and an empty space, Rostov, to avoid getting into the front line again, as he had during the attack of the horse guards, followed the line of the reserves, making a wide circle around the place where the hottest shooting and cannon fire were heard. Suddenly, ahead of him and behind our troops, in a place where he could never have supposed the enemy to be, he heard nearby musket fire.::1831-08-18
Manchester::408514.858227617::“Well, then, young man?” he said, sighing and looking into Rostov’s eyes from under his raised eyebrows. Some sort of light, quick as an electric spark, passed from Telyanin’s eyes to the eyes of Rostov and back, and forth and back again, all in an instant.::2012-04-24
Chelan Falls::174018.8889624029::“Is this your saber?” he shouted. The girls jumped away. Denisov, with frightened eyes, hid his shaggy legs under the blanket, glancing at his friend for help. The door admitted Petya and closed again. Behind the door there was laughter.::1990-08-12
Espanola::849201.3827768879::The only moment she took a real part in was when they remembered Sonya’s first arrival. Sonya told how she was afraid of Nikolai, because he had a jacket with cords on it, and her nanny told her that she, too, would be stitched with cords.::1904-04-17
Billings::591242.2024222588::“Hurrah!” cried Prince Andrei, barely able to hold up the heavy standard, and he ran forward with unquestioning assurance that the entire battalion would run after him.::1865-04-03
Summitview::44252.57390209292::“But how is that?…” said Prince Andrei, who had already been waiting a long time for a chance to express his doubts.::1810-10-20
Geneva::5943.054165789885::Being an enthusiast had become her social position, and she sometimes became enthusiastic even when she had no wish to, so as not to deceive the expectations of people who knew her. The restrained smile that constantly played on Anna Pavlovna’s face, though it did not suit her outworn features, expressed, as it does in spoiled children, a constant awareness of her dear shortcoming, which she did not wish, could not, and found no need to correct.::1890-02-13
Queets::747469.0996402374::“And I just didn’t recognize you,” he said. But Rostov could not be bothered, he was shouting “Hurrah!”::1866-04-05
Wollochet::31431.134302184248::“Denisov, we’re here!—he’s asleep,” he said, leaning his whole body forward, as if hoping by this posture to speed up the movement of the sleigh. Denisov did not respond.::2018-11-11
Pueblo::708329.8997988865::But when Katya brought the dress requested, Princess Marya was still sitting motionless before the mirror, looking at her face, and saw in the mirror that tears had welled up in her eyes and her mouth was trembling, getting ready to weep.::1997-05-13
Palm Bay::851465.8726195213::He pictured himself as of enormous size, a mighty man, flinging cannonballs at the French with both hands.::2004-07-06
Ruff::413331.808492263::“Pecause, my tear sir,” he said, pronouncing the b  as a p  and the d  as a t,  “pecause the emperor knows that. He said in the manifesto that he cannot look mit intifference at the tangers that threaten Russia, and that the security of the empire, its tignity, and the sacretness of its alliances …” he said, for some reason giving special emphasis to the word alliances,  as if this was the essence of the matter.::1992-09-12

Glenwood::50604.64721066449::“Add two more notches and it’ll be just right,” he shouted in a high-pitched voice, trying to give it a dashing sound, which did not go with his little figure. “Number two,” he squeaked. “Smash ’em, Medvedev!”::1814-05-03
Riverbend::193349.49832952465::“Third,” Pierre went on, not listening to him, “you are never to say a word about what happened between you and the countess. I know I can’t forbid you that, but if there’s a spark of conscience in you…” Pierre silently paced the room several times. Anatole sat by the table, frowning and biting his lips.::1991-01-05
Samish::177747.16532112734::“Will you go to Iogel’s, Nikolenka? Please do,” Natasha said to him, “he has asked you specially, and Vassily Dmitrich (that is, Denisov) is going.”::1892-04-21
Trout Lake::25245.69264671539::“See where God granted us to meet again,” said the small man. “Tushin, Tushin—remember, I gave you a ride at Sch246;ngraben? I’ve had a bit cut off, see…” he said, smiling and showing the empty sleeve of the robe. “It’s Vassily Dmitrich Denisov you’re looking for? He’s my roommate,” he said, on learning who Rostov wanted. “This way, this way.” And Tushin led him to the other room, from which came the loud laughter of several voices.::1975-07-12
Centennial::662109.7812083265::“Mon p232;re—Andr233;?”  said the graceless, awkward princess, with such an inexpressible loveliness of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father could not endure her gaze and, sobbing, turned away.::1940-06-24
Richmond::684403.9693715528::Half an hour later the rhetor came back to transmit to the seeker the seven virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon’s temple, which every Mason was supposed to cultivate in himself. These virtues were: (1) discretion,  keeping the secrets of the order; (2) obedience  to the higher ranks of the order; (3) good morals;  (4) love of mankind;  (5) courage;  (6) generosity;  and (7) love of death.::1955-09-14
Hansville::581185.4794893825::As he was saying this, he got up, went over to his sister, and, bending down, kissed her on the forehead. His fine eyes shone with an intelligent and kindly, unhabitual light, but he was looking not at his sister but into the darkness of the open doorway, over her head.::1919-08-02
Wickersham::415694.95123499975::“I think, however, that there are also grounds for these condemnations,” said Prince Andrei, trying to fight against Speransky’s influence, which he was beginning to feel. He disliked agreeing with him in everything: he wanted to contradict. Prince Andrei, who usually spoke easily and well, had difficulty expressing himself now in talking with Speransky. He was too taken up with observing the person of the famous man.::1870-01-17
Pompano Beach::724863.6313142073::“Well, let’s give it a try, Captain, see how far it will carry!” said the general, turning to the artillerist. “Have some fun out of boredom.”::1878-10-25
Oysterville::95141.70180431736::Princess Marya had long ago abandoned her book: she was sitting silently, her luminous eyes fixed on her nanny’s wrinkled face, familiar to her in the smallest detail: on the lock of gray hair that strayed from under her kerchief, at the little pouch of skin that hung under her chin.::1917-05-12
North Charleston::20585.14326393024::Saddle horses stood by this house, and the suite was gathering, evidently preparing for the sovereign’s levee.::1822-11-23
Melbourne::240068.0307309593::At the Rostovs’ it was the name day of the Natalyas, mother and younger daughter.24 Since morning, coach and sixes had constantly been driving up and leaving, bringing people with congratulations to the big house of the countess Rostov on Povarskaya Street, which was known to all Moscow. The countess with her beautiful older daughter and the guests, who constantly replaced each other, were sitting in the drawing room.::1928-12-05
Plymouth::921172.8962465569::Pierre hastily went up to her. He thought that she would give him her hand, as always; but, coming close to him, she stopped, breathing heavily and lowering her arms lifelessly, in exactly the same pose in which she came out to the middle of the room to sing, but with quite a different expression.::1854-01-02
Everett::33807.595768669205::Striking his horse with his long, muscular legs, as if it was all the horse’s fault, the colonel moved forward and commanded the second squadron, the one in which Rostov served under Denisov, to go back to the bridge.::1989-02-04
Satsop::547624.511738199::The person to whom Anna Pavlovna treated her guests as a novelty that evening was Boris Drubetskoy, who had just come as a courier from the Prussian army, where he was an adjutant attached to a very important person.::1898-07-04

Peshastin::843515.0215747898::“Yes, she’s all right. Good speed,” Nikolai replied. “If only there was a seasoned hare running through the field, I’d show you what kind of dog she is!” he thought. And turning to his groom, he said he would give a rouble to the hunter who could spot a hare in its form.::1929-10-07
Marble::498334.3788442885::Pierre took off his spectacles, and his eyes, on top of the general strangeness of people’s eyes when they take off their spectacles, had a frightened and questioning look. He was about to bend down to her hand and kiss it; but she, with a quick and crude movement of her head, intercepted his lips and brought them together with her own. Her face struck Pierre by its altered, unpleasantly perplexed expression.::1897-11-08
South Snohomish::221757.25318650363::“Countess Natasha,” replied Denisov. “And how well she dances, what race!” he said again, after some silence.::1830-10-14

Waterbury::352328.0424381588::“I’ve heard about cases of that sort, and I know that the sovereign is very severe on such occasions. I think it should not get as far as his majesty. In my opinion, it would be better to ask the corps commander directly…But generally I think…”::1883-09-20
Nisqually::520810.2839051524::The entire suite now drew back, and Rostov saw the general speak about something with the sovereign for a rather long time.::1815-06-06
Tillicum::870974.28689377::“For not overstaying and clinging to a woman’s skirt. Service before all. Thank you, thank you!” And he went on writing, so that spatters flew from his scratching pen. “If you want to say something, speak. I can do the two things at once,” he added.::1840-09-15
Anatone::640401.749031043::“The highest wisdom and truth is like the most pure liquid, which we want to receive into ourselves,” he said. “Can I receive this pure liquid in an impure vessel and then judge its purity? Only by purifying myself inwardly can I keep the liquid I receive pure to some degree.”::1800-01-02
Tulalip::386324.60763956286::Neither her father and mother, nor Sonya, nor Prince Andrei himself could have foreseen how parting with her fianc233; would affect Natasha. Flushed and agitated, her eyes dry, she wandered about the house that day, occupying herself with the most insignificant things, as if not understanding what awaited her. She did not cry when, at the moment of taking leave of her, he kissed her hand for the last time.::1873-02-06
Orient::204417.10134132273::“Je suis votre  faithful slave, et 224; vous seule je puis l’avouer.  My children—ce sont les entraves de mon existence. *18 That’s my cross.

Keller::325254.271679307::“In the beginning I didn’t like it much, because what is it that makes a city pleasant? Ce sont les jolies femmes, *376 isn’t that so? Well, but now I like it very much,” he said, looking at her meaningfully. “Will you come to this carousel, Countess? Please do come,” he said and, reaching his hand out to her bouquet and lowering his voice, he said: “Vous serez la plus jolie. Venez, ch232;re comtesse, et comme gage donnez-moi cette fleur.” †377::1944-10-19
Marblemount::639099.2914186034::“Mama!” she said. “Give him  to me, mama, quickly, quickly,” and she again had difficulty holding back her sobs.::1958-09-02
Turner::927432.9767181423::“An institution supportive of this honor, the source of competition, is an institution like the L233;gion d’honneur  of the great emperor Napoleon, which is not detrimental, but contributes to the success of the service, and not the privilege of rank or position at court.”::1901-02-03
West Palm Beach::348615.59797656996::“Against your will He will save you and have mercy on you and turn you to Him, because in Him alone there is truth and peace,” she said in a voice trembling from emotion, with a solemn gesture holding up in both hands before her brother an old oval icon of the Savior with a blackened face, in a silver setting, on a finely wrought silver chain.::2012-02-04
Boulder::112650.58587696153::“Very glad to see you. Go in where they’ve assembled, and wait for me.” The sovereign went to the study.

Riner::263231.12351804203::They all wished for only one thing: to go quickly against the enemy under the sovereign’s leadership. Under the command of the sovereign himself, it would be impossible not to defeat anyone whatever—so thought Rostov and most of the officers.::1934-02-11
Powhatan::246673.9875339101::“Cependant, mon cher,”  he said, studying his fingernail from a distance and gathering up the skin over his left eye, “malgr233; la haute estime que je professe pour le  Orthodox Russian armed forces,8 j’avoue que votre victoire n’est pas des plus victorieuses.” *189::2017-03-24
Natural Bridge::654314.9708241691::The conversation ended with the count, who wished to be magnanimous and not be subjected to new requests, saying he would give him a promissory note for eighty thousand.

McClure::720490.004459941::“Imagine, we got into the front line! Our regiment went into an attack!” said Boris, smiling that happy smile which occurs in young men who have been under fire for the first time.::1995-09-16
Brownsburg::131099.7195996324::“Pyotr Kirilyich,” she began, speaking quickly, “Prince Bolkonsky was your friend—is your friend,” she corrected herself (it seemed to her that everything only was and that now it was all different). “He told me then to turn to you…”::1908-01-22
Burgess::112065.73688577392::Prince Andrei sensed in Natasha the presence of a special world, completely foreign to him, filled with joys of a sort as yet unknown to him, that foreign world which even then, in the Otradnoe avenue and at the window on that moonlit night, had enticed him so. Now that world no longer enticed him, it was no longer foreign; but he himself, having entered it, found in it a new delight.::1821-11-07
Lake Barcroft::344642.5375755485::“Dolokhov, Marya Ivanovna’s son,” she said in a mysterious whisper, “they say he has totally compromised her. He introduced him, invited him to his house in Petersburg, and now…She has come here, and that daredevil after her,” said Anna Mikhailovna, wishing to express her sympathy for Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half smile expressing her sympathy for the daredevil, as she called Dolokhov. “They say Pierre is totally crushed by his grief.”::1972-01-15
Clover::744676.4486221388::In the front hall, Denisov, crouching on the threshold with his pipe, sat facing the sergeant major, who was reporting something.

Broken Arrow::951437.6366842302::The hounds were united into a single pack, and the uncle and Nikolai rode side by side. Natasha, wrapped in shawls, from which her lively face peeked out with its bright eyes, galloped up to them, accompanied by Petya, who never left her side, and Mikhailo, a hunter and riding master, who was assigned to look after her. Petya laughed at something, and whipped and pulled his horse. Natasha adroitly and confidently sat her black Arabchik and with a sure hand effortlessly reined him in.::1961-06-16
Verona::109314.27509550162::Natasha left off only when they told her there would be pineapple ice cream. Before the ice cream, champagne was served. The music struck up again, the count kissed his dear countess, and the guests, rising, wished the countess a happy name day, and clinked glasses across the table with the count, the children, and each other. Again the waiters scurried about, chairs scraped, and the guests, in the same order but with redder faces, returned to the drawing room and the count’s study.::1906-05-16

Ashburn::505580.5448599939::He reached out and put his hand on the purse. Rostov let go of it. Telyanin took the purse and began to lower it into the pocket of his riding breeches, his eyebrows raised casually, and his mouth slightly open, as if he was saying: “Yes, yes, I’m putting my purse in my pocket, and it’s quite simple, and it’s nobody’s business.”::1830-11-01
Lakeland::266679.19358658785::“Oh, undoubtedly,” said Prince Andrei, and suddenly, with unnatural animation, he began joking with Pierre about how he ought to be careful in dealing with his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and in the middle of the banter got up and, taking Pierre by the arm, drew him aside.::1877-11-01
Gwynn::731665.1297020891::Boris quietly went to the door and followed Natasha out; the fat boy angrily ran after them, as if vexed at the disturbance that had interfered with his pursuits.::1992-08-14

Santa Maria::960562.4099674175::“But you’re still afraid! Eh, you learned people,” said a third, manly voice, interrupting the two others. “That’s why you artillerists are so learned, because you can tote everything along with you, both vodka and grub.”::2015-04-09
University Heights::241888.31494093753::“What about it, Fedeshou!…Did he say when the fighting would begin? You were standing closer. They all said Boonapart himself was stationed in Brunovo.”::1878-09-09
Batesville::462519.1751108567::At this ball Pierre felt insulted for the first time by the position his wife occupied in high spheres. He was sullen and distracted. There was a deep furrow across his brow, and, standing by the window, he looked through his spectacles, seeing no one.::1874-12-18
Whitetop::180829.5288520424::A third of the guests had already arrived at the ball, but the Rostovs, who were to be there, were still hurriedly preparing to dress.::1901-01-07

Hillsboro::385221.25599322544::Prince Vassily frowned, his mouth twisted to one side, his cheeks twitched with an unpleasant, coarse expression peculiar to him; he roused himself, got up, threw his head back, and with a resolute stride walked past the ladies into the small drawing room. He strode quickly, joyfully up to Pierre. The prince’s expression was so extraordinarily joyful that Pierre stood up, frightened, when he saw him.::1856-02-04
Green Bay::499876.2546744671::“Well, what do you want, then? You’re all in love these days. Well, if you’re in love, marry him,” the countess said, laughing crossly. “God help you!”::1937-08-23

Henry::876269.5097745704::Pierre listened to her attentively and gravely. Prince Andrei left the room. And after him, Princess Marya left the people of God to finish their tea and took Pierre to the drawing room.::1853-03-23
Tyler::762280.384622866::“Whatever happens to you,” he said, “you must courageously endure everything, if you are firmly resolved to enter our brotherhood.” (Pierre responded affirmatively by inclining his head.) “When you hear knocking on the door, you will unbind your eyes,” added Willarski. “I wish you courage and success.” And, pressing Pierre’s hand, Willarski went out.::1837-05-08

Fancy Gap::211458.17604135408::On hearing gunfire in the vanguard, the young emperor could not restrain his desire to be present at the battle, and, despite all the remonstrations of his courtiers, at noon, having separated from the third column with which he was proceeding, he rode to the vanguard. Before he reached the hussars, several adjutants met him with news of the successful outcome of the action.::2001-01-11
Burbank::738016.8938255928::“Well, aren’t you a fool!” shouted the prince, shoving the notebook away, but he got up at once, paced about, touched the princess’s hair with his hands, and sat down again.::1885-07-19
Greeley::142266.3642400479::“There are pickets on the hill, Your Excellency, in the same place as this evening,” Rostov reported, bending forward, holding his hand to his visor, and unable to repress a cheerful smile, called up in him by his ride and above all by the whine of the bullets.::1872-08-25
San Mateo::154401.56157911022::“The highest wisdom and truth is like the most pure liquid, which we want to receive into ourselves,” he said. “Can I receive this pure liquid in an impure vessel and then judge its purity?

Schuyler::384332.58990246797::“Anatole would come to borrow money from her and would kiss her bare shoulders. She didn’t give him the money, but allowed him to kiss her. Her father, joking, tried to arouse her jealousy; she said with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: he can do as he likes, she said of me. I asked her once whether she felt any signs of pregnancy. She laughed scornfully and said she was not such a fool as to want to have children, and that she would not have children from me. ”::1991-12-17
El Cajon::914427.8323963702::“Don’t say that to me. I don’t want anything. I love you as a brother, and will love you always, and I need nothing more.”::1826-11-14
Penhook::311401.5117546071::“She said…yes, she said: ‘Girl’ (to the femme de chambre ), ‘put on a livr233;e  and come with me, behind the carriage, faire des visites .’”*65::1969-02-19

Laurel Park::338521.9281624375::“How shall I tell you,” Natasha replied. “I was in love with Boris, with my teacher, with Denisov, but this is not the same at all. I feel peaceful, firm. I know that there’s no one better than he, and I feel so calm, so good now. Not at all like before…”::1866-03-17
Bayside::934377.7396753599::Do not break ranks on the pretext of removing the wounded! Let each of you be fully pervaded by the thought that we must defeat these mercenaries of England, inspired by such hatred of our nation. This victory will end our campaign, and we will be able to return to our winter quarters, where new French troops, now being raised in France, will find us; and then the peace which I will conclude will be worthy of my people, you, and myself.::1958-06-11
Lignum::40363.66940560432::“Mais, ma pauvre Catiche, c’est clair comme le jour .*121 He alone is then the legitimate heir to everything, and you won’t get even this much.

Tysons::601989.6267361493::The stately figure of Nesvitsky, accompanied by the Cossack, and the resoluteness of Denisov, waving his saber and shouting desperately, had such an effect that they pushed through to the other end of the bridge and stopped the infantry. At the exit Nesvitsky found the colonel to whom he was to give the order, and, having fulfilled his mission, rode back again.::1886-04-17
Mappsburg::693638.7777199417::The girl smiled and took it. Like everyone else on the bridge, Nesvitsky never took his eyes off the women until they had passed. Once they had passed, there again came the same soldiers, with the same talk, and finally everybody stopped. As often happens, the horses pulling the company cart balked at the exit from the bridge, and the whole crowd had to wait.::1879-01-13

Calverton::240091.97463127185::He was happy with the gratitude shown him, but ashamed as he received it. This gratitude reminded him how much more  he could do for these simple, good people.::1809-07-21
Fulks Run::746664.2036165124::“Wait,” cried Dolokhov, tapping the bottle against the window to attract attention. “Wait, Kuragin; listen. If anybody else does the same, I’ll pay him a hundred imperials. Understood?”::1982-07-18
Amelia Court House::568399.4390400428::“Ohh! my beauty!” cried the count. “Better than any of you!…” He was about to embrace her, but she retreated, blushing, so as not to have her dress rumpled.::1894-12-06
Davie::292541.09606912447::“Why, as if he’s going to hunt out from under our hounds! It was my mouse-gray bitch that caught it. Go on, take it to court! He grabs hold of the fox!

Las Cruces::667457.9339768552::Her brother often wondered, looking at her. It did not seem at all as if she was a loving fianc233;e separated from her future husband. She was level-headed, calm, altogether as cheerful as before. This surprised Nikolai, and it even made him look mistrustfully at this alliance with Bolkonsky. He did not believe that her fate was already decided, the less so as he had not seen her together with Prince Andrei. He kept thinking there was something wrong with this projected marriage.::1989-12-01
Crockett::994557.6416789124::“Educate this bear for me,” he said. “He’s been living with me for a month, and this is the first time I’ve seen him in society. Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the company of intelligent women.”::1811-06-15
Buckingham::271983.9813277446::“Insolent fellows!” said the prince. “Do you know M233;tivier? I threw him out today. He was here, he was let in to see me, though I had asked them not to let anybody in,” said the prince, looking angrily at his daughter. And he recounted the whole conversation with the French doctor and the reasons why he became convinced that M233;tivier was a spy. Though those reasons were quite insufficient and unclear, no one objected.::1806-08-08
South Bend::529953.2517323546::Pierre took off his spectacles, and his eyes, on top of the general strangeness of people’s eyes when they take off their spectacles, had a frightened and questioning look. He was about to bend down to her hand and kiss it; but she, with a quick and crude movement of her head, intercepted his lips and brought them together with her own.

Susan::109024.65913467208::During his service, mostly as an adjutant, Prince Andrei had seen many anterooms  of significant persons, and the differing characters of these anterooms  were very clear to him.

Lebanon Church::288214.84915635776::“Your way of thinking is known to me,” said the Mason, “and this way of thinking of yours, which you are talking about and which seems to you the result of your own mental work, is the way of thinking of the majority of people, the monotonous fruit of pride, laziness, and ignorance. Forgive me, my dear sir, but if I did not know it, I would not be talking with you. Your way of thinking is a lamentable error.”::1925-11-13
Brumley Gap::501326.18445811607::“Crew, to your pieces!” the officer commanded, and in a minute the artillery crew ran merrily from their campfires and loaded up.::1826-02-04
Patrick Springs::730777.9075489615::“The squadron can’t pass,” shouted Vaska Denisov, angrily baring his white teeth, spurring his handsome raven-black Bedouin, who, twitching his ears from running into bayonets, snorting, spraying foam around him from his bit, jingling, stamped his hooves on the planks of the bridge and seemed ready to jump over the railing if his rider would let him.::2011-01-25
San Angelo::906108.3319726004::“Why the postponement? Why no betrothal?” he thought. Talking with his mother once about his sister, he found, to his surprise and partly to his satisfaction, that deep in her heart his mother also sometimes looked mistrustfully at this marriage.::1978-12-04

Roanoke::915459.7773073972::The doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and joked with her, paying no attention to her grief-stricken face. On the other hand, when he went out to the other room, the countess hurriedly followed him, and he, assuming a serious air and shaking his head pensively, said that, although there was danger, he had hopes for the effectiveness of this latest medicine, and that they must wait and see; that the illness was more moral, but…::1945-01-24
Kenosha::182368.4401240262::“You could do it even now. You go to the barn and listen. If you hear banging or knocking, it’s bad; if you hear grain pouring, it’s good. But it also happens…”::1929-08-17

Tuscaloosa::781170.0381452787::The affair was presented by the offended side in such guise that, after seizing the transport, Major Denisov, uninvited, in a drunken state, appeared at the quartermaster general’s, called him a thief, threatened him with a beating, and, when removed, rushed into the office, attacked two clerks, and dislocated the arm of one.::1875-01-17

Sparks::269385.8686826087::Rostov rode at a walk, not knowing why and to whom he was going now. The sovereign was wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible not to believe it now.

What was he to say now to the sovereign or to Kutuzov, even if they were alive and not wounded?::1845-04-22
Vacaville::789019.1631240769::Four days earlier, the sentinels of the Preobrazhensky regiment were standing by the house to which Balashov was brought; now two French grenadiers stood there, in blue uniforms open on the chest and shaggy hats.

It happens to everybody,” his son said in a careless, brazen tone, while in his soul he considered himself a villain, a scoundrel, whose whole life would not be enough to redeem his crime.

Whitesville::833706.357565996::Prince Andrei, looking straight ahead, listened silently to Pierre’s speech. A few times he asked Pierre to repeat words he had not heard because of the noise of the carriage.

Westminster::121377.65076692864::“If they had known that you wished it, the f234;te would have been cancelled,” said the prince, uttering out of habit, like a wound-up clock, things that he did not even wish people to believe.::1855-09-22
Atkins::228267.7490273992::“Do you realize what you’re saying?” he said in a trembling voice. “Besides me, there was no one else in the room. Which means, if that’s not it, then…”::1804-05-10
Greenville::416421.27449830255::He covered the girls’ albums with verses and music, and, without taking leave of any of his acquaintances, having finally sent off the entire forty-three thousand and received Dolokhov’s receipt, left at the end of November to catch up with his regiment, which was already in Poland.::1803-05-18
Nampa::46166.432032179626::He spoke that refined French in which our grandparents not only spoke but thought, and with those quiet, patronizing intonations which are proper to a significant man who has grown old in society and at court. He went over to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting her with his perfumed and shining bald pate, and settled comfortably on the sofa.::1884-09-02
Ladysmith::455281.1390518192::“But do you take it without sugar?” she asked, with the same smile as if everything she said and everything the others said was very funny and had some other meaning.::1932-08-07
Whaleyville::333120.0275879019::Seeing the impression the news of her brother’s wound made on Sonya, Natasha felt for the first time the whole grievous side of this news.::1853-12-03
Edmond::126301.76647222324::Meanwhile, Nesvitsky, Zherkov, and the officer of the suite stood together out of the range of fire and looking at this small bunch of men in yellow shakos, dark green jackets embroidered with cord, and blue breeches, pottering about by the bridge and, on the other side, at blue coats and groups with horses, which could easily be identified as artillery, approaching in the distance.::1937-04-22
Blue Ridge Shores::396409.22384500457::“And the prisoners he killed in Africa?”19 said the little princess. “It’s terrible!” And she shrugged her shoulders.::1887-05-11
Montclair::968366.0068010452::“I’m saying it to you sincerely as a friend. Consider. Where will you go now, and what for, when you can stay here? One of two things awaits you” (he gathered the skin over his left temple): “either peace will be concluded before you reach the army, or it will be defeat and disgrace along with the whole of Kutuzov’s army.”::1816-07-08
Bend::489230.7545313129::The red Lyubim overtook Milka, precipitously threw himself at the wolf, and seized him by the hindquarters, but in the same second became frightened and jumped over to the other side. The wolf crouched, clacked his teeth, got up again, and loped on, accompanied at two yards’ distance by all the dogs, who would not go nearer to him.::1904-04-23
Carmel::512703.26602863014::“Consider my position, Pyotr Nikolaich: if I were in the cavalry, I’d get no more than two hundred roubles every four months, even with the rank of sublieutenant; while now I get two hundred and thirty,” he said with a joyful, pleasant smile, looking at Shinshin and the count as though it was obvious to him that his success would always constitute the chief goal of everyone else’s desires.::1813-07-10
San Leandro::644906.094087722::Kutuzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes flashed over his face as when he had turned away from Captain Timokhin. He turned away and winced, as if wishing to express thereby that all that Dolokhov had said to him and all that he could say had long, long been known to him, that it all bored him, and that it was all by no means what was needed. He turned away and made for the coach.::1819-01-16
Templeton::407421.6596616028::“I told you, it’s all bumps and hollows,” the little princess repeated. “I’d be glad to fall asleep myself, so it’s not my fault.” And her voice quavered, like the voice of a child who is about to cry.::1970-09-24
Winterpock::7064.271884469009::Natasha, wasted, with a pale and stern face (not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected her to be), was standing in the middle of the drawing room. When Pierre appeared in the doorway, she became flustered, obviously undecided whether to go to him or wait for him.::1911-08-02
Stevens Creek::637608.7878456777::Balashov rode on, supposing from Murat’s words that he would quite soon be introduced to Napoleon himself. But instead of meeting Napoleon soon, he was detained by sentinels of Davout’s infantry corps at the next village, as he had been at the front line, and the summoned adjutant of the corps commander took him to the village to Marshal Davout.::1988-10-15
Millboro::845300.6060028509::Bolkonsky recognized Prince Repnin, whom he used to meet in Petersburg society. Next to him stood another wounded officer of the horse guards, a nineteen-year-old boy.::1839-12-22
Bracey::438818.1858290469::“Ah, Sonya, if you knew him as I do! He said…He asked me what sort of promise I had made to Bolkonsky. He was glad that it rested with me to refuse him.”::1878-04-22
Fishers::271333.83408589585::“Well, if it’s long, we can take it up, we can take it up in a minute,” said the resolute Dunyasha, taking a needle out of the fichu on her breast and setting to work again on the floor.::1903-03-13
Deltona::868587.8251209733::The prince’s house was not what was known as “society,” but it was a small circle which, though not much talked about in town, it was very flattering to be received in. Boris had understood that a week ago, when, in his presence, Rastopchin had said to the commander in chief, in response to his invitation to dinner on St. Nicholas’s day, that he could not come:::1949-10-08
Concord::58255.518039716626::“What do I care about your allies?” said Napoleon. “I have the Poles for allies: there are eighty thousand of them, they fight like lions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them.”::2001-06-17
Tracy::648510.5779387096::The uncle played another song, then a waltz; then, after a pause, he cleared his throat and struck up his favorite hunting song:::1987-07-25
Moneta::463685.2260005748::“Inform the prince that I haf set feuer  to the bridge,” the colonel said triumphantly and cheerfully.::1967-01-21
Glen Wilton::153635.12388019284::“Me tried for robbery—ach! Give me more water—let them try me, but I’ll beat the scoundrels, I’ll always beat them, and I’ll tell the sovereign. Give me ice,” he kept murmuring.::1989-11-23
Eggleston::122774.93460647382::Pierre began telling about what he had done on his estates, trying as far as possible to hide his own share in the improvements he had made. Prince Andrei prompted Pierre beforehand several times in what he was telling, as if everything Pierre had done was a long-known story, and he listened not only without interest, but even as if ashamed at what Pierre was telling him.::1996-07-09
Yogaville::631955.7502501816::“You know, that fat Pierre, who sat across from me, is so funny!” Natasha said suddenly, stopping. “I feel so merry!”::1858-05-03
Suffolk::814422.2695683714::The assistant looked exhausted. He was clearly waiting with vexation for the garrulous doctor to leave.::1890-03-02
Rushmere::198419.64947275547::The third time the rhetor came back sooner and asked Pierre whether he was still firm in his intention and was determined to submit himself to everything that was demanded of him.::1996-06-11
Asheville::974176.2199280591::The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the fat staff officer, at Zherkov, and frowned.::1919-01-13
Dumbarton::192333.48104271275::All through the argument and the rest of dinner, the little princess was silent and kept glancing fearfully now at Princess Marya, now at her father-in-law. When they left the table, she took her sister-in-law by the arm and led her to another room.::1897-01-17
Fort Hunt::495318.2168273689::During the night of the twelfth of June, on the eve of action, there was violent rain and a thunderstorm. The summer of 1812 was generally remarkable for its storms.::1817-04-02
Goldvein::764832.7864342375::A still greater feeling of pity, tenderness, and love took hold of Pierre. He felt tears flowing behind his spectacles and hoped they would not be noticed.::1989-05-06
Prices Fork::607349.430176217::“Ma bonne amie,”  the little princess said on the morning of the nineteenth of March, and her mustached little lip rose by old habit; but as, ever since the day the terrible news had been received, there had been sorrow not only in the smiles, but in the sounds of talk, even in the footsteps in that house, so now the smile of the little princess, who had succumbed to the general mood—though she did not know its cause—was such that it was all the more a reminder of the general sorrow.::1947-07-08
Rio::603822.2736690672::“But I didn’t say a word about the sovereign,” the officer defended himself, unable to explain Rostov’s outburst otherwise than by his being drunk.::1939-12-25
Livermore::896703.1857677012::“And who’s this one?” she said, addressing her governess and looking into the face of her daughter, who was dressed as a Kazan Tartar. “Seems to be one of the Rostovs. Well, and you, Mister Hussar, which regiment do you serve in?” she asked Natasha. “That Turk, give that Turk some fruit jelly,” she said to the butler with a tray, “their law doesn’t prohibit it.”::1939-08-01
Sussex::99679.7094127343::On the eve of his departure from Petersburg, Prince Andrei brought along Pierre, who had not once been to the Rostovs’ since the time of the ball. Pierre looked perplexed and embarrassed. He was talking with the mother. Natasha sat down with Sonya by the chess table, thereby inviting Prince Andrei to join her. He went over to them.::1985-08-23
Newton::282914.7912336474::“Count, Count!” cried Berg, as animated as Boris, running up to him from the other side. “Count, I’m wounded in the right hand,” he said, showing his hand, bloody and bandaged with a handkerchief, “and I stayed in the line. I hold the sword in my left hand, Count: our race, the von Bergs, Count, were all knights.”::1825-01-17
Fort Chiswell::739533.4226772845::Pierre did not hear what they were saying, but he knew it was about him. He blushed and turned away.::1837-07-03
Fall River::386839.7801861354::The hussar only sighed, making no reply, and cleared his throat angrily. Down the line of hussars the hoofbeats of a trotting horse were heard, and suddenly out of the night mist, looking like a huge elephant, emerged the figure of a hussar sergeant.::1943-04-20
Pungoteague::752782.8117632995::“Let’s go to my sister,” said Prince Andrei, returning to Pierre. “I haven’t seen her yet, she’s hiding now and sitting with her people of God. It will serve her right, she’ll get embarrassed, but you’ll see the people of God. C’est curieux, ma parole. ”*317::1885-10-04
Hot Springs::83011.1176289794::“Rostov! Greetings! We haven’t seen each other,” he said and could not help asking what had happened to him: so strangely dark and upset was Rostov’s face.::1846-01-02
Manchester::973029.6865188513::The infantry regiments, caught unawares in the woods, ran out of the woods, and, companies mixing with other companies, retreated in disordered crowds. One soldier uttered in fear the words: “Cut off!”—senseless and terrible in time of war—and the words, together with the fear, communicated themselves to the whole mass.::1970-07-06
Sandy Level::825834.0992886509::“Never, Marya Genrikhovna,” the officer replied, “we must wait upon our doctor. Maybe he’ll pity me when he’s cutting off my leg or arm.”::1841-08-09
Menifee::432754.52492658095::Nikolai, continuing to pace the room, glanced gloomily at Denisov and the girls, avoiding their eyes.::1897-08-10
West Falls Church::223986.06440633562::Then the same people, with undiminished satisfaction and fear, saw how the young count, all red, with bloodshot eyes, dragged Mitenka out by the scruff of the neck, chose a convenient moment between his words, applied foot and knee with great deftness to his rear end, and shouted: “Out, scoundrel, and don’t leave a trace behind!”::2009-06-14
Weyers Cave::124981.48202933057::“Mama!” she said. “Give him  to me, mama, quickly, quickly,” and she again had difficulty holding back her sobs.::1820-10-05
Walkerton::797896.1329568853::Rostov, standing in the front ranks of Kutuzov’s army, which the sovereign rode up to first, had the same feeling that was experienced by every man in that army—a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud awareness of strength, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this solemnity.::1847-11-23
Indio::876330.4397599718::Boris Drubetskoy, en gar231;on  (playing the bachelor), as he put it, having left his wife in Moscow, was also at this ball, and, though not an adjutant general, contributed a large sum to the subscription for the ball. Boris was now a rich man, far advanced in honors, no longer seeking patronage, but standing on an equal footing with the highest of his peers.::1906-02-16
Enon::186823.47723626214::“Oh, very much! My brother knows him: he dined with him, the present emperor, more than once in Paris, and he told me that he never saw a more subtle and clever diplomat—you know, a combination of French adroitness and Italian playacting. Do you know the anecdotes about him and Count Mark243;v? Count Mark243;v was the only one who knew how to handle him. Do you know the story of the handkerchief? It’s charming!”::1907-04-22
Arvonia::94068.0734860142::Denisov rode to the staff straight from the regimental commander, with a sincere wish to follow his advice. In the evening he returned to his dugout in such a state as Rostov had never yet seen him in. Denisov could not speak and was gasping for breath. When Rostov asked what was the matter with him, he only uttered incomprehensible oaths and threats in a hoarse and weak voice.::1895-06-21
Isle of Wight::244773.48857825986::The war was heating up, and its theater was approaching the borders of Russia. Everywhere curses were heard on the enemy of the human race Bonapartius; militia and recruits were being gathered from the villages, and divergent news kept coming from the theater of the war, false as usual and therefore reinterpreted in various ways.::1807-08-02
Daleville::960588.6675749375::“Yes, yes, please, or it will get late,” he said, and, nodding his head, lowered it and again closed his eye.::2004-07-08
Matoaca::664090.2928749606::The next day the emperor’s gentleman-in-waiting, M. de Turenne, came to Balashov and conveyed to him the emperor Napoleon’s wish to honor him with an audience.::1973-07-18
Fair Oaks::858502.1518742205::“No,” he said, growing more and more inspired, “Napoleon is great, because he stood above the revolution, put an end to its abuses, and kept all that was good—the equality of citizens and freedom of speech and of the press—and that is the only reason why he gained power.”::1820-01-13
Temperanceville::83114.9787509753::Several days after Anatole’s departure, Pierre received a note from Prince Andrei, informing him of his arrival and asking Pierre to come to see him.::1965-06-24
Gratton::746926.1152540136::“I agree with you completely,” replied Nikolai, blushing all over, turning his plate and rearranging the glasses, and with such a determined and desperate air as though he was exposed right then to great danger. “I’m convinced that the Russians must either die or conquer,” he said, aware himself, as the others were, once the word had been spoken, that it was too rapturous and pompous for the present occasion and therefore awkward.::1999-04-07
Franconia::355060.61228090647::“Let’s go to my sister,” said Prince Andrei, returning to Pierre. “I haven’t seen her yet, she’s hiding now and sitting with her people of God. It will serve her right, she’ll get embarrassed, but you’ll see the people of God. C’est curieux, ma parole. ”*317::1938-06-10
Collinsville::964262.7720482043::“Permission? Permission? You young people are always that way,” said the regimental commander, cooling down a little. “Permission? Say something to you, and you…” The regimental commander paused. “Say something to you, and you…What?” he said, getting irritated again. “Kindly dress your men properly…”::1906-10-23
Norwalk::271859.1180080507::“And why should you believe that he is my lover?…Why? Because I like his company? If you were more intelligent and agreeable, I’d prefer yours.”::1912-04-02
Cats Bridge::41379.85899468055::The little princess either did not hear or did not want to hear his words. She was silent and seemed embarrassed. The prince asked about her father, and the princess began to speak and smiled. He asked her about mutual acquaintances: the princess became still more animated and started talking away, giving the prince greetings and town gossip.::2007-07-07
Waukegan::373591.00851725845::“You sleep, I can’t,” the first voice answered, coming close to the window. She evidently leaned all the way out of the window, because he could hear the rustle of her dress and even her breathing. Everything became hushed and stone-still, like the moon and its light and shadows. Prince Andrei was also afraid to stir, lest he betray his involuntary presence.::1922-10-09
Bland::68436.83702239023::The happy state of mind of the officers after the review passed itself on to the soldiers. The company walked along merrily. On all sides soldiers’ voices exchanged remarks.::1930-05-04
Huntington::964339.8977485648::Prince Andrei smiled, looking at his sister, as we smile listening to people whom we think we can see through.::1829-10-18
Brightwood::157620.65171401907::“C’est bien beau ce que vous venez de dire,” *115 Julie, who was sitting next to him, said with a sigh. Sonya trembled all over and blushed to her ears, behind her ears, and down her neck and shoulders, as Nikolai was speaking. Pierre listened to what the colonel said and nodded approvingly.::1988-03-08
Sanford::475906.71111547214::“For a dear friend, no detour’s too long,” Prince Vassily began, as usual, quickly, self-confidently, and familiarly. “Here is my second one, I recommend him to your loving kindness.”::1983-06-08
Sugar Land::551718.0276611601::Dolokhov was holding the Englishman by the hand and clearly, distinctly articulating the terms of the bet, mainly addressing Anatole and Pierre.::1816-07-08
Sperryville::667201.5199649784::Berg always spoke very precisely, calmly, and courteously. His conversation was always concerned with himself alone; he always kept calmly silent when the talk was about something that had no direct relation to himself. And he could be silent like that for several hours, without experiencing in himself or causing in others the slightest embarrassment. But as soon as the conversation concerned him personally, he began to speak expansively and with obvious pleasure.::1822-12-17
Waterford::258668.90536450938::“Ah, for pity’s sake, you keep saying stupid things, and you keep wanting to wait—see, we’ve waited,” said Prince Andrei in a spiteful whisper, clearly with the wish to sting his sister.::1810-09-13
Sugarland Run::699580.3226378731::“Very glad to see you, Prince,” he said. “Just a moment…” he turned to Magnitsky, interrupting his story. “We’ve agreed that tonight will be a dinner for pleasure and not a word about business.” He turned back to the speaker and laughed again.::1818-04-04
Tiptop::670062.023659852::“Here are her letters,” he said, “and her portrait.” He took the bundle from the table and handed it to Pierre.::1959-10-12
Deerfield::713842.1906544599::“Come, come, dearest uncle,” Natasha moaned in such an imploring voice as though her life depended on it. The uncle got up, and it was as if there were two men in him—one smiled gravely at the jolly fellow, while the jolly fellow performed a na239;ve and precise little caper before dancing.::1962-07-23
Meadowbrook::183741.4235267434::“Vous savez, mon mari m’abandonne,”  she went on in the same tone, turning to a general, “il va se faire tuer. Dites moi, pourquoi cette vilaine guerre?” #31 she said to Prince Vassily and, not waiting for an answer, turned to Prince Vassily’s daughter, the beautiful H233;l232;ne.::1919-05-22
Selma::987044.1025594157::“Gentlemen, the disposition for tomorrow, for today even (because it’s already past twelve), cannot be changed,” he said. “You have heard it, and we will all do our duty. And there’s nothing more important before a battle…” (he paused) “than a good night’s sleep.”::1968-01-04
Churchville::988056.9789876667::“Le Roi de Prusse!”  and, having said it, he began to laugh. Everyone turned to him. “Le Roi de Prusse?”  Ippolit asked, laughed again, and again calmly and seriously sat back in the depths of his armchair. Anna Pavlovna waited a little, but as it seemed that Ippolit decidedly had no intention of saying more, she began to tell about how the godless Bonaparte purloined the sword of Frederick the Great in Potsdam.::2005-08-10
Springville::868110.0219367779::After M233;tivier’s departure, the old prince called his daughter to him, and all the force of his wrath fell upon her. It was her fault that a spy had been let in to his rooms. Yet he had told her, he had told her to make a list and not let in anyone not on the list. Why had this scoundrel been let in? She was the cause of it all. “With her he could not have a moment’s peace, he could not die in peace,” he said.::1828-08-20
Fort Smith::30722.32375652273::Though Nikolai Rostov, keeping firmly to his intention, went on serving in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little money, the way of life at Otradnoe was such, and Mitenka in particular so conducted business, that the debts mounted irresistibly every year. The only help the old count could evidently envisage was government service, and he went to Petersburg to seek a post; to seek a post and at the same time, as he said, to amuse the girls for the last time.::1889-07-20
Saxe::733969.4240122498::After dinner he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little princess was sitting at a small table chatting with the maid Masha. She turned pale when she saw her father-in-law.::1851-04-07
Parrott::81361.97054549232::That was perfectly correct, but the count, and the countess, and Natasha—everyone looked at her with reproach. “Who does she take after?” thought the countess.::1976-03-25
Hawthorne::50475.6418449529::“I don’t know, I can’t say, my lad. Just think, I’ve got three hospitals to myself, four hundred and some patients! It’s a good thing some Prussian charitable ladies send us two pounds of coffee and lint24 a month, otherwise we’d have perished.” He laughed. “Four hundred, my lad, and they keep sending new ones. It is four hundred? Eh?” he turned to the assistant.::1808-08-08
Potomac Mills::948734.3753681969::“Ne me tourmentez pas. Eh bien, qu’a-t-on d233;cid233; par rapport 224; la d233;p234;che de Novosilzoff? 2Vous savez tout.” ‡7::1922-09-10
Great Falls::560425.6190969058::Prince Andrei looked at him with kindly eyes. But in his friendly, gentle gaze a consciousness of his own superiority still showed.::2006-07-08
Naruna::880231.0806937129::Noticing Anna Mikhailovna and her son, Prince Vassily dismissed the doctor with a bow and silently, but with a questioning look, came over to them. The son noticed how deep grief suddenly appeared in his mother’s eyes and smiled slightly.::1872-02-19
Nashua::194601.21893652415::When an apple ripens and falls—what makes it fall? Is it that it is attracted to the ground, is it that the stem withers, is it that the sun has dried it up, that it has grown heavier, that the wind shakes it, that the boy standing underneath wants to eat it?::1843-03-22
Skyland Estates::7852.822348854982::The guests stood in the ballroom, crowding by the door, waiting for the sovereign. The countess placed herself in the first rows of this crowd. Natasha heard and felt that several voices were asking about her and looking at her. She realized that she was liked by those who paid attention to her, and this observation reassured her somewhat.::1961-02-12
Lynch Station::640122.5449414299::The next day the emperor’s gentleman-in-waiting, M. de Turenne, came to Balashov and conveyed to him the emperor Napoleon’s wish to honor him with an audience.::1903-05-03
Claypool Hill::522623.9528317156::“It’s all over,” he thought, and cold sweat broke out on his forehead. Bewildered, he went over to the crib, certain that he would find it empty, that the nanny was hiding the dead baby. He opened the curtain, and for a time his frightened, unfocused eyes could not find the baby. At last he saw him: the red-cheeked boy lay sprawled across the crib, his head lower than the pillow, smacking and moving his lips in his sleep, and breathing regularly.::1921-08-01
Chino::775657.1071220112::“They offered him other lands in place of the dukedom of Oldenburg,” said Prince Nikolai Andreich. “He moves dukes around the way I move peasants from Bald Hills to Bogucharovo and my Ryazan estates.”::1836-12-20
Kirkland::49602.36684930086::“Now, Sofya Alexandrovna’s sure to see something,” Dunyasha said in a whisper, “because you just laugh all the time.”::1950-01-18
Edinburg::286856.25091176026::“General, I am duty-bound to obey orders, but I am not duty-bound to put up with…” Dolokhov said hastily.::1952-09-09
Reading::433816.42450996005::Despite the fact that in Moscow the Rostovs belonged to high society without knowing or thinking what society they belonged to, in Petersburg their society was mixed and indefinite. In Petersburg they were provincials to whom the very people that the Rostovs fed in Moscow without asking what society they belonged to would not lower themselves.::1892-02-23
Dunn Loring::56478.51682987237::He sometimes comforted himself with the thought that he happened to be leading this life just so, in the meantime; but then he would be horrified by another thought, that it was just so, in the meantime, that so many people had entered this life, this club, as he had, with all their teeth and hair, and come out of it with not a single tooth or hair left.::1872-05-08
Bellingham::124826.55972921042::Zherkov, not taking his hand from his cap, briskly started his horse and galloped off. But as soon as he left Bagration, his strength failed him. An insurmountable fear came over him, and he was unable to go where there was danger.::1977-06-07
Citrus Heights::926110.4506411098::“Attack, indeed!” the colonel said in a bored voice, wincing as if a fly was pestering him. “And why are you standing here? You can see the flanks are retreating. Bring the squadron back across.”::1966-01-14
Concord::426351.5110442133::The old count rode home. Natasha and Petya stayed with the hunt, promising to come at once. The hunt went further on, because it was still early. At midday the hounds were loosed into a ravine overgrown with dense, young forest. Nikolai, standing in the stubble, could see all his hunters.::1836-09-07
Whittier::987252.603551589::The next day the sovereign stayed at Wischau. The court physician Villiers was summoned to him several times. In headquarters and among the nearby troops the news spread that the sovereign was unwell. He had eaten nothing and slept poorly that night, as people close to him said. The cause of it was the strong impression made on the sovereign’s sensitive soul by the sight of the wounded and dead.::1956-01-06
Modest Town::196538.5734514522::“Ah, you’ll just disturb the old man!” said the countess. “And there’s no room to turn around in his place. If you go anywhere, it should be to the Melyukovs’.”::1936-11-21
Fairlawn::867302.6629922648::And, as if to let the Russian general feel still more his dependence on brute force, Davout sent his adjutant for the officer on duty.::1836-04-24
Ogden::776507.699515919::“I’m glad that I could give you pleasure, my dearest Anna Mikhailovna,” said Prince Vassily, straightening his jabot and in his gesture and voice displaying here, in Moscow, before the patronized Anna Mikhailovna, far greater importance than in Petersburg, at Annette Scherer’s soir233;e.::1999-09-04
Newport Beach::862463.0874026048::“Yes, gentlemen, I’ve been told there’s a rumor going around Moscow that I’m a cardsharper, so I advise you to be more careful with me.”::1822-08-09
University Center::80758.00255230736::The Austrian general had a displeased look, but he had no choice but to answer Kutuzov in the same tone.::1891-01-03
Lively::764620.6965583296::As fresh air from the fields suddenly breathes through an open window into a stuffy room, so youth, energy, and certainty of success breathed upon Kutuzov’s cheerless staff as these brilliant young men galloped up.::1930-04-03
Nethers::796546.5791203878::“So, Sonya, here you were saying all kinds of stupid things about him,” Natasha began in a meek voice, the sort of voice in which children speak when they want to be praised. “He and I had a talk tonight.”::1989-10-22
Hampden Sydney::644605.744096141::“Did you hear about the latest event at the review in Petersburg? What a show the new French ambassador made of himself!”::1907-01-06
Champaign::791960.8589042631::“There’s still time, my friend. Remember, Catiche, it was all done inadvertently, in a moment of wrath, illness, and then forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to correct his mistake, to alleviate his last moments by not allowing him to do this injustice, by not letting him die thinking he has made unhappy those people who…”::1917-02-24

O'Fallon::724859.3485023809::“What a pity you weren’t at the Arkharovs’ on Thursday. I was bored without you,” she said, smiling tenderly at him.::1929-06-09
Purdy::224180.7177871261::But at that moment Miloradovich was obviously thinking least of all of what the generals were arguing about.::1852-08-14
Highland Springs::907129.4036309527::“The auditor wrote a petition for you,” Tushin went on, “and you ought to sign it, and, see, you can send it with him” (he pointed to Rostov). “He’s surely got a hand in at the staff. There couldn’t be a better chance.”::1827-12-02
Massanetta Springs::45857.980692237674::Sonya fell to thinking. The question of how to write to Nicolas, and whether she should write to him, was a question that tormented her. Now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero, would it be right on her part to remind him of herself and, as it were, of the commitment he had taken upon himself in her regard.::1913-11-07
Clifton::492475.31445343926::“He knows everything,” said Marya Dmitrievna, pointing to Pierre and addressing Natasha. “Let him tell you whether I’ve spoken the truth.”::1837-03-21
Chantilly::388780.74245641637::It was now the hot period of spring. The woods were now fully clothed, it was dusty and so hot that, passing by water, one wanted to go for a swim.::1935-02-09
New Hope::386033.69925040286::While on campaign, Rostov allowed himself the liberty of riding a Cossack horse instead of a regimental one. A fancier and a hunter, he had recently obtained for himself a fine, big, dashing Don horse, light chestnut with a white mane and tail, on which no one could outgallop him. It was a pleasure for Rostov to ride this horse. He thought about the horse, about the morning, about the doctor’s wife, and never once thought about the impending danger.::1854-11-05
Dry Fork::735327.6667310968::The princess said nothing. All that could be heard were the sounds of the efforts of the struggle over the portfolio. It was clear that if she did start to talk, it would not be flattering for Anna Mikhailovna. Anna Mikhailovna held on tight, but in spite of that her voice retained all its sweet, drawling softness.::1942-02-01
Toano::280681.7778722784::“To the right from the corridor; there, Euer Hochgeboren, *186 you will find the imperial adjutant on duty,” said the official. “He will take you to the minister of war.”::1930-03-21
Saluda::122127.91986836857::On St. Nicholas’s day, the prince’s name day, all Moscow came to his door, but he gave orders to receive no one and to invite only a few to dinner, the list of whom he gave to Princess Marya.::1863-10-18

They’ll tell him, and he’ll marry not only you but anyone else as well; but you’re free to choose…Go to your room, think it over, and in an hour come to me and say in his presence: yes or no. I know you’ll be praying. Well, pray then. Only you’d better think. Now go.”::1898-03-06
Jewell Ridge::901400.4145829702::“Yes, yes, who else? I’d never have believed it, but this feeling is stronger than I am. Yesterday I was tormented, I suffered, but I wouldn’t trade that torment for anything in the world. I’ve never lived before. Only now am I alive, but I can’t live without her. But can she love me?…I’m too old for her…Why don’t you speak?…”::1998-03-22
Shipman::782759.2204322411::“So I have, good sir,” the old woman replied garrulously. “Just before Christmas I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy, heavenly mysteries20 with the monks there. And now I’m coming from Kolyazin, where a great blessing has been revealed…”::1937-11-01
Bloomington::795738.2957004958::“La r233;serve, sire!”  someone’s voice replied, so human after the non-human voice that had said: “Les hussards de Pavlograd?”::1896-11-13
Rice::919863.7235404557::When Prince Meshchersky left, Prince Andrei took Pierre by the arm and invited him to the room he had been given. There was a rumpled bed in the room and open suitcases and trunks. Prince Andrei went over to one of them and took out a box. From the box he took a bundle of papers. He did it all silently and very quickly. He straightened up and cleared his throat. His face was frowning, his lips were compressed.::1920-06-10
Triangle::475298.3159005991::Boris knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the newspapers, and was hearing about Villeneuve for the first time.::1801-11-13

Ivy::230171.77632138852::Returning late in the evening, Sonya came into Natasha’s room and, to her surprise, found her still dressed, asleep on the sofa. On the table next to her lay the opened letter from Anatole. Sonya picked up the letter and started reading it.::1914-06-02
Ettrick::575825.1510784314::“I beg Your Majesty’s pardon,” said Balashov, “besides Russia there is also Spain, where there are just as many churches and monasteries.”::1830-06-16
Harborton::577155.2139235447::“Ah, Bondarenko, friend of my heart,” he said to the hussar who came rushing for his horse. “Give him a cooling down, my friend,” he said with that merry brotherly tenderness with which all fine young men treat everyone when they are happy.::1908-04-12
Palm Coast::951792.155183498::They all dispersed and, except for Anatole, who fell asleep as soon as he lay down, it was long before anyone slept that night.::1852-04-23
Prince George::27116.835058154877::“If he, however, is senior to mine in the ranking,” the German hussar colonel said, turning red and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, “leave him to do as he wants. I my hussars cannot sacrifice. Bugler! Sound the retreat!”::1810-04-14
Flint Hill::503852.9251553483::He pointed to the convent with its towers, visible on the hilltop. He smiled, his eyes narrowed and lit up.::1947-08-02
Quinby::797409.6307256665::“Well, all right, all right,” cried Denisov, “now there’s no getting out of it, you owe us a barcarolle,  I beg you.”::1859-06-25

Mechanicsville::649334.2450986034::Rostov, avoiding Denisov’s eyes, began to button his jacket, buckled on his saber, and put on his peaked cap.::1811-05-20
Lafayette::163554.44814790232::“You there, brother!” the Cossack said to a supply soldier with a cart, who was pushing through the infantrymen crowded right against his wheels and horses, “you there! As if you can’t wait: look, the general needs to pass.”::1899-12-11
Nathalie::251042.8386819411::Carousers, those male Magdalenes, have a hidden sense of awareness of their innocence, just as female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope of forgiveness. “Everything will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and everything will be forgiven him, for he had much fun.”11::1968-11-22
Hoover::68788.93592548862::“Allez, mon ami,” *285 said Princess Marya. Prince Andrei went to his wife again and sat in the next room waiting. Some woman came out of the room with a frightened face and became embarrassed on seeing Prince Andrei. He covered his face with his hands and sat that way for several minutes. Pitiful, helplessly animal moans came from behind the door. Prince Andrei got up, went to the door, and wanted to open it. Someone was holding the door.::1870-05-05
Mount Sidney::53364.37203395506::“Ah, my God! My God!” he said. “And to think of who—of what nonentities—can be the cause of people’s unhappiness!” he said with a malice that frightened Princess Marya.::1859-11-13

Central Point::204964.8174705885::“What’s there to look at?” said the assistant. But precisely because the assistant obviously did not want to let him go in, Rostov entered the soldiers’ wards. Here the stench, which he had managed to get used to in the corridor, was still stronger. The stench here was slightly different: it was sharper, and one could sense that it was coming precisely from here.::1840-10-23
Lowes Island::105592.60967733996::“Edward Karlych, please play my favorite Nocturne  by Monsieur Field,”9 the voice of the old countess said from the drawing room.::1904-03-04
Bloomington::38940.20560296274::“But you’re still afraid! Eh, you learned people,” said a third, manly voice, interrupting the two others. “That’s why you artillerists are so learned, because you can tote everything along with you, both vodka and grub.”::1987-12-20
Burkes Garden::389436.0953332388::On the thirteenth of July, the Pavlogradskies were to take part in serious action for the first time.::1903-11-18
Ivanhoe::327854.53912773286::Nikolai Rostov, with Denisov and his new acquaintance, Dolokhov, sat together almost at the middle of the table. Opposite them sat Pierre, beside Prince Nesvitsky. Count Ilya Andreich sat opposite Bagration, together with the other stewards, and did the honors for Prince Bagration, personifying Moscow hospitality in himself.::1983-05-02
Hemet::648449.305512747::“No, I considered it incorrect and did not follow it,” Pierre said, so softly that the rhetor did not hear and asked him what he had said. “I was an atheist,” Pierre replied.::1894-10-01
Mount Pleasant::137119.7509420431::“Yes, wait,” said Denisov, glancing at the officers, and, taking his papers from under the pillow, he went to the window, where there was an inkstand, and sat down to write.::1907-08-03

Merrifield::669028.1756968936::Half an hour later an old lady in a farthingale appeared in the room among the other mummers—this was Nikolai. The Turkish woman was Petya.

Madison Heights::704344.433310874::“How are you going to find such balance?” Pierre began; but just then Anna Pavlovna came over and, with a stern glance at Pierre, asked the Italian how he was taking the local climate. The Italian’s face suddenly changed and acquired an insultingly false sweetness of expression, which was probably habitual with him in conversations with women.::1806-01-02
Deep Creek::112731.52108958762::Dolgorukov, one of the most fervent advocates of the offensive, had just come back from the council, weary, exhausted, but animated and proud of the victory won. Prince Andrei introduced the officer he was patronizing, but Prince Dolgorukov, giving him a polite and firm handshake, said nothing to Boris and, obviously unable to keep from speaking out the thoughts that occupied him most at that moment, addressed Prince Andrei in French.::1969-05-14
Santa Fe::328680.5071095367::Everyone began running, hurrying, and Rostov saw behind him on the road several horsemen with white plumes in their hats riding up. In a single moment, everyone was in his place and waiting.::2001-02-08

Kent::162103.0294355871::“Au moins changez la coiffure,”  said the little princess. “Je vous disais,”  she said with reproach, turning to Mlle Bourienne, “Marie a une de ces figures, auxquelles ce genre de coiffure ne vas pas du tout. Mais du tout, du tout. Changez de gr226;ce.” §244::1922-09-21

King George::587437.1591017911::Nikolai dismounted and stood by the hounds with Natasha and Petya, who joined him, waiting for news of how the matter would end. The hunter who had been fighting left the edge of the woods with the fox strapped to his saddle and rode over to his young master. He took off his hat while still some distance away and tried to speak respectfully; but he was pale, breathless, and his face was angry. He had a black eye, but he probably did not know it.::1979-04-20
Newtown::251896.7634039625::“If she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady, she’ll be my wife,” Prince Andrei quite unexpectedly said to himself, looking at her. She went to her cousin first.::2004-07-04
Mission::795517.4932038925::“I don’t like these fashionable churches,” she said, obviously proud of her freedom of thought. “God is the same everywhere. We have a wonderful priest, he celebrates properly, with some nobility, and so does the deacon. Is it some sort of holiness if the choir sings a concert? I don’t like it, it’s nothing but indulgence!”::1985-03-08
Bryan::53987.1373328843::“Because I’ve made an observation: a young man usually comes to Moscow from Petersburg only with the aim of marrying a rich bride.”::1828-02-04

Rocky Gap::498657.2492826908::Kutuzov turned away without answering him, and his gaze chanced to rest on Prince Andrei, who was standing close by. Seeing Bolkonsky, Kutuzov softened the angry and caustic expression of his gaze, as if aware that his adjutant was not to blame for what was going on. And, without answering the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolkonsky:::1846-05-15
Buena Park::432005.37247858825::The next day the troops set out on the march, and Boris had no time up to the battle of Austerlitz itself to visit either Bolkonsky or Dolgorukov and remained for a time with the Izmailovsky regiment.::1836-05-03

What is that?” shouted the regimental commander, thrusting his lower jaw out and pointing to a soldier in the ranks of the third company who was wearing a greatcoat of blue factory broadcloth, different from the other greatcoats. “Where have you been? We’re expecting the commander in chief, and you leave your post? Eh?…I’ll teach you to dress your people in gaudy colors for a review!…Eh!…”::2016-06-22
Dryden::600392.9495668401::“What, he’s been reduced to a field marshal, is it, or to a common soldier? If it’s a common soldier, then he should be dressed in the proper uniform like everybody else.”::1880-01-16
Elk Hill::174316.45910146486::Oh, how that third had vibrated, and how touched was something that was best in Rostov’s soul. And that something was independent of anything in the world and higher than anything in the world. What are gambling losses, and Dolokhovs, and words of honor!…It’s all nonsense! One can kill, and steal, and still be happy…::1811-11-17
Horntown::292445.9966509232::“Well, my friend, tomorrow we’re off at last,” he said to him one day, closing his eyes, fingering Pierre’s elbow, and in such a tone as if what he said had been decided between them long, long ago and could not have been decided otherwise.::1810-05-10
Low Moor::34572.88846827078::“Tomorrow,” thought Rostov, “I may very well be sent on some sort of mission to the sovereign. Thank God!”::1866-07-03
Gladstone::27538.042856930177::Napoleon met Balashov with a cheerful and benign air. Not only was there no expression in him of embarrassment or self-reproach for his morning’s outburst, but, on the contrary, he tried to encourage Balashov. Clearly it was Napoleon’s long-standing conviction that the possibility of mistakes did not exist for him, and to his mind everything he did was good, not because it agreed with any notion of what was good and bad, but because he  did it.::1821-04-19
Oak Grove::783629.4757220851::Valuev told confidentially that Uvarov had been sent from Petersburg to find out the opinion of the Muscovites about Austerlitz.::1900-07-18

Cicero::998713.4799053931::But when Katya brought the dress requested, Princess Marya was still sitting motionless before the mirror, looking at her face, and saw in the mirror that tears had welled up in her eyes and her mouth was trembling, getting ready to weep.::1811-06-01
Bealeton::774229.4648916841::“But what has happened between you?” she asked. “What has he told you? Why can’t he visit our house?”::1983-07-07
Avondale::105384.49086248936::Having sat at the table for a while, Speransky corked the wine bottle and saying: “Good wine costs a pretty penny these days,” handed it to the servant and got up. They all got up and with the same noisy talk went to the drawing room. Speransky was handed two envelopes brought by a courier. He took them and went to his study. As soon as he left, the general merriment died down, and the guests began talking sensibly and quietly with each other.::1813-04-20
Savage Town::264164.5650458304::Since the time of his gambling loss, Rostov had resolved to pay back the debt to his parents within five years. They used to send him ten thousand a year, but now he resolved to take only two and leave the rest to his parents in repayment of his debt.::1878-09-03
Sioux City::717033.3352437222::“Hallooloo,” Rostov said in a whisper, protruding his lips. The dogs, jingling the metal rings of their collars, jumped up, cocking their ears. Karai finished scratching his haunch and stood up, cocking his ears and slightly wagging his tail, from which tufts of fur hung.::1920-07-16
Blue Ridge::742741.217190988::“The one thing that’s hard for me—to tell you the truth, Andr233;—is father’s way of thinking in the religious respect. I don’t understand how a man with such an enormous intellect cannot see what is clear as day and can be so deluded. That constitutes my one unhappiness. But here, too, I’ve seen a shade of improvement recently. His mockery recently hasn’t been so biting, and there’s a monk whom he received and with whom he spoke for a long time.”::1850-09-20
Ravensworth::201071.65395438575::“You already got caught once over a petite fille, ” said Dolokhov, who knew about Anatole’s marriage. “Watch out.”::1849-11-08
Merced::518144.9814437593::In a most modest way, not once mentioning himself, Bolkonsky told about the action and his reception by the minister of war.::1964-01-08
McCoy::429654.39788990933::“Wait, he’s not drunk. Give me a bottle,” said Anatole, and taking a glass from the table, he went up to Pierre.::1968-01-03
Bellwood::886636.6732548206::“Sickness or no sickness, he’d better not show his face to me—I’ll kill him!” Denisov shouted out bloodthirstily.::1896-02-23
Shawsville::838589.0040072291::Prince Vassily, one leg crossed high up on the other, a snuffbox in his hand, as if moved to the utmost, and as if regretting and laughing at his sentimentality himself, was sitting with a smile of tender emotion on his face. When Princess Marya came in, he quickly brought a pinch of snuff to his nose.::1862-10-06
Drewryville::663031.5305151601::Having listened to these words, the regimental commander hung his head, silently heaved his shoulders, and spread his arms in a sanguine gesture.::1929-04-01
Wyndham::651312.0969353883::“They barely managed to save the poor fellow,” the guest went on. “That’s how intelligently the son of Count Kirill Vladimirovich Bezukhov amuses himself!” she added. “And I heard he was so well-bred and intelligent. There’s what all this foreign upbringing leads to. I hope no one receives him here, despite his wealth. They wanted to introduce him to me. I decidedly refused: I have daughters.”::1850-07-21
Saint George::394413.25383248494::“No, Sonya, do you remember him so as to remember everything, remember really well,” said Natasha, with an assiduous gesture, evidently wishing to give her words the most serious meaning. “I remember Nikolenka, too, I do,” she said. “But not Boris. I don’t remember him at all.”::1832-06-02
Conroe::764439.0565972023::As he was saying this, he got up, went over to his sister, and, bending down, kissed her on the forehead. His fine eyes shone with an intelligent and kindly, unhabitual light, but he was looking not at his sister but into the darkness of the open doorway, over her head.::1934-07-21
Spring Creek::455694.8304424202::Tikhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew his master’s train of thought. He guessed that he was being asked about Prince Vassily and his son.::1955-02-09
Pratts::330817.49982007744::“Quelle d233;licieuse personne, que cette petite princesse!” **32 Prince Vassily said to Anna Pavlovna.::1822-04-24
Pastoria::328900.7795772633::“That’s the young countess—right you are!—I’ve never seen another like her!” he said, handing a pipe with a long chibouk to Rostov, and, with a habitual gesture, tucking another, its chibouk cut short, between three fingers.::1933-04-13
Union Level::857121.8497257329::“Nowadays, in order to please Moscow girls, il faut 234;tre m233;lancolique. Et il est tr232;s m233;lancolique aupr232;s de mademoiselle Karagine, ”†364 said Pierre.::1892-08-10
East Lexington::593614.9272285531::The only moment she took a real part in was when they remembered Sonya’s first arrival. Sonya told how she was afraid of Nikolai, because he had a jacket with cords on it, and her nanny told her that she, too, would be stitched with cords.::1965-07-06
Wattsville::852924.6227379102::“I’ve come to sit with you, Mashenka,” said the nanny, “and here I’ve brought the prince’s wedding candles15 to light before the saint, my angel,” she said, sighing.::1884-10-18
Mount Airy::684439.0615999026::All the while he was in the battery by the cannon, as often happens, he had never stopped hearing the sounds of the officers’ voices, talking in the lean-to, but had not understood a single word of what they were saying. Suddenly the sound of voices from the lean-to struck him with such soul-felt tones that he involuntarily began to listen.::1985-06-14
Ferrum::142604.0940543246::“We’re going,” Nikolai answered reluctantly, being intent on some serious wolf hunting that day and not wanting to bring Natasha and Petya along. “We’re going, but only for wolves: you’d be bored.”::1894-10-22
Pleasanton::883108.4223128274::“Capital!” Prince Ippolit said in English and began slapping his knee with his palm. The viscount merely shrugged.::1875-11-25
Cloverdale::298765.2292563412::“I don’t know your sister well enough,” Prince Andrei replied with a mocking smile, behind which he hoped to hide his embarrassment, “to answer such a subtle question. And besides, I’ve observed that the less attractive the woman, the more constant she is,” he added and looked at Pierre, who approached them just then.::1895-06-22
Longview::29688.15362589261::Pierre was gloomily silent, answered monosyllabically, and seemed to be immersed in his own thoughts.::1957-07-05
Triplet::154404.15399356355::Pierre was thinking about Prince Andrei, that he was unhappy, that he was mistaken, that he did not know the true light, that Pierre had come to his aid, to enlighten him and raise him up. But as soon as Pierre thought of how and what he was going to say, he had the feeling that Prince Andrei would discredit his entire teaching with a single word, a single argument, and he was afraid to begin, afraid to expose his favorite, sacred thing to the possibility of ridicule.::1864-08-21
Medford::254344.65570732602::The regimental doctor came and said it was necessary to bleed him. A deep dish of dark blood came from Denisov’s shaggy arm, and only then was he able to tell what had happened to him.::1885-08-19
Owenton::436071.7240308496::Anatole, whom he had been seeking, dined that day at Dolokhov’s and discussed with him how to mend the spoiled affair. It seemed necessary to him that he see Miss Rostov. In the evening, he went to his sister’s, to discuss with her the means of arranging this meeting. When Pierre, having driven in vain all over Moscow, returned home, the valet told him that Prince Anatole Vassilievich was with the countess. The countess’s drawing room was filled with guests.::1850-03-14
Meherrin::110029.72852874704::“What, are you wounded, dear heart?” asked Tushin, coming to the cannon on which Rostov was sitting.::1965-12-02
DeWitt::621887.4948703101::In Petersburg, just as in Moscow, an atmosphere of affectionate, loving people surrounded Pierre. He could not refuse the post or, rather, the rank (because he did nothing) that Prince Vassily had provided him with, and the acquaintances, invitations, social occupations were so many that Pierre experienced, even more than in Moscow, a feeling of fogginess, hurriedness, and some ever approaching but never attained good.::1936-06-05
Pohick::910741.9215962879::“Ils sont arriv233;s, Marie, *239 do you know?” said the little princess, waddling in with her belly and lowering herself heavily into an armchair.::1933-03-05
Henry Fork::210504.3762316875::Pierre, his shoulders hunched and his mouth gaping, listened to what Marya Dmitrievna was telling him and could not believe his ears. Prince Andrei’s fianc233;e, so deeply loved, this once sweet Natasha Rostov, to exchange Bolkonsky for that fool Anatole, who was already married (Pierre knew the secret of his marriage), and fall in love with him so much as to agree to elope with him!—that Pierre could not understand and could not imagine.::1986-12-08
Chester Gap::215341.13054441285::Another voice, that of a not very tall man with clear blue eyes, especially striking amidst all these drunken voices by its sober expression, shouted from the window: “Come here—break the grip!” This was Dolokhov, an officer of the Semyonovsky regiment, a notorious gambler and duellist, who lived with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking around merrily.::1884-10-12
Warwick::354993.27770597744::“Ah, money, Count, money—there’s so much grief in the world because of it!” said the countess. “But I need this money very badly.”::1945-04-22
Mount Solon::676223.3254382628::“Column, form up for the attack!” The infantry ahead of them doubled up their platoons to let the cavalry pass by. The uhlans set off, pennants flying on their lances, and trotted downhill towards the French cavalry, which had appeared at the foot of the hill to the left.::1859-08-18
Westland::751507.9421747857::“Your Excellency, here are two trophies,” said Dolokhov, pointing to the French sword and pouch. “I captured an officer. I stopped the company.” Dolokhov was breathing heavily from fatigue; he spoke with pauses. “The whole company can testify. I ask you to remember, Your Excellency!”::1893-12-13
Somerville::911681.0332693752::“Whatever happens to you,” he said, “you must courageously endure everything, if you are firmly resolved to enter our brotherhood.” (Pierre responded affirmatively by inclining his head.) “When you hear knocking on the door, you will unbind your eyes,” added Willarski. “I wish you courage and success.” And, pressing Pierre’s hand, Willarski went out.::1800-08-08
McLean::180039.69927696016::“Le g233;n233;ral Koutouzoff,”  said Bolkonsky, emphasizing the last syllable, zoff , like a Frenchman, “a bien voulu de moi pour aide-de-camp…” ‡45::1891-09-14
Brambleton::557251.5620675869::“It seems I can congratulate you,” Anna Pavlovna whispered to the princess and kissed her warmly. “If it weren’t for my migraine, I would have stayed.”::1810-10-11
Sweet Briar Station::427991.8520517114::They went up to the door of the sitting room, through which came the sounds of the same passage repeated again and again. Prince Andrei stopped and winced, as if expecting something unpleasant.::1963-02-09
Melbourne::805431.1374233827::Sonya began to watch her friend still more attentively, and noticed that all through dinner and in the evening, Natasha was in a strange and unnatural state (responded beside the point to questions put to her, began phrases and did not finish them, laughed at everything).::1916-08-14
Milford::731671.3158804348::Dimmler began to play. Inaudibly, on tiptoe, Natasha went to the table, picked up the candle, took it out, came back, and quietly sat down in her place. The room was dark, especially on the sofa where they were sitting, but the silver light of the full moon fell on the floor through the big windows.::1958-04-19
Pender::343478.488481061::“Ah, here he is at last!” cried Rostov. “And Berg’s here, too! Ah, you petisenfan, allay cushay dormir! ”*260 he cried, repeating the words of their nanny, at whom he and Boris used to laugh together.::1826-11-06
Passapatanzy::441542.5083748934::“A seasoned one?” asked Ilagin, approaching the hunter who had spotted the hare and turning, not without excitement, to whistle up Yerza…::1835-06-20
Castlewood::549878.8292938621::“Au moins changez la coiffure,”  said the little princess. “Je vous disais,”  she said with reproach, turning to Mlle Bourienne, “Marie a une de ces figures, auxquelles ce genre de coiffure ne vas pas du tout. Mais du tout, du tout. Changez de gr226;ce.” §244::1920-06-02
Lakewood::341443.9683482234::“Tonight Schubert will be dining with us, a colonel in the Pavlogradsky hussar regiment. He’s been on leave here and is taking him along. What to do?” said the count, shrugging his shoulders and speaking jokingly about a matter that obviously cost him much grief.::1893-03-04
Farmington Hills::900138.7781071279::“Well, really! This, they say, is the commander of all the emperor Alexander’s guards,” said the first, pointing to a wounded Russian officer in the white uniform of the horse guards.::1915-12-09
Westlake Corner::565555.795955576::“See what egoists all men are; all, all egoists! For the sake of his whims, God knows why, he abandons me, he locks me up in the country alone.”::1884-08-25
Shenandoah Retreat::901533.0369501819::It was amusing and touching to look at these enamoured girls, but the sight of them evidently did not arouse any pleasant feelings in Vera.::2013-04-05
Sugar Grove::219383.24001844434::“Now you have seen the lesser light,” someone’s voice said to him. Then candles were lit again, the voices said he must see the full light, and his eyes were uncovered again, and more than ten voices suddenly said: “Sic transit gloria mundi.” *292::1916-02-21
Harriston::5164.972367946219::At first the old man stared at his son with fixed eyes and an unnatural smile that revealed his newly missing tooth, which Prince Andrei could not get used to.::1909-12-24
Cluster Springs::274884.23768889427::Prince Andrei looked once more at the little figure of the artillerist. There was something special in it, totally unmilitary, slightly comical, but extremely attractive.::1850-11-15
Alberene::820898.5044886176::Rostov felt ill-humored immediately after he noticed the displeasure on Boris’s face, and, as always happens with people who are ill-humored, it seemed to him that everyone was looking at him hostilely and that he was hampering them all. And indeed he was hampering them all and alone remained outside the newly initiated general conversation. “Why is he sitting here?” said the glances cast at him by the guests. He got up and went over to Boris.::1987-12-24
Mavisdale::207490.44006337936::They had just ridden up a hill past a tavern, when a bunch of horsemen appeared, riding towards them from the foot of the hill, at the head of whom, on a black horse, its trappings gleaming in the sun, rode a tall man in a plumed hat, with black, curled, shoulder-length hair, in a red mantle, his long legs thrust forward, as Frenchmen ride. This man galloped to meet Balashov, his plumes flying, his jewels and gold galloons shining in the bright June sun.::1958-07-10
Pauls Crossroads::836996.0574974344::And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed for Prince Andrei all his former interest in the reforms being carried out. That same day Prince Andrei was supposed to dine at Speransky’s “en petit comit233;,” *348 as the host had said when inviting him. This dinner in the circle of family and friends of the man whom Prince Andrei so admired had formerly interested him very much, the more so as he had not yet seen Speransky in his domestic surroundings; but now he did not want to go.::1871-07-22
Cranston::193912.70269792504::“You know, that fat Pierre, who sat across from me, is so funny!” Natasha said suddenly, stopping. “I feel so merry!”::1803-09-07
Madisonville::73316.70347539964::Before Rostov had time to think and determine how far away those shots were, Count Ostermann-Tolstoy’s adjutant came galloping from Vitebsk with orders to proceed down the road at a trot.::1866-04-17
Nottoway Court House::906640.1741020479::“It’s vile, low, inhuman to take advantage of the weakness…” She did not finish. “Get out of my room,” she cried and burst into sobs.::1972-02-08
Guinea::407736.3673762471::“I need a lot, Count, I need five hundred rubles.” And, taking out a cambric handkerchief, she began rubbing her husband’s waistcoat.::1849-12-08
Timberlake::166026.6860762881::“Oh, oh!” gasped Nesvitsky, as if from burning pain, seizing the officer of the suite by the arm. “Look, he’s fallen, one of them has fallen, fallen!”::1911-02-21
Spotsylvania Courthouse::818262.0428666611::“Attendez,”  Anna Pavlovna said, pondering. “Tonight I’ll discuss it with Lise (la femme du jeune  Bolkonsky). And maybe something can be settled. Ce sera dans votre famille que je ferai mon apprentissage de vielle fille. ”††24::2011-05-05
Forest::914860.1516410505::“Believe me,” said Prince Dolgorukov, addressing Bagration, “this is nothing but a ruse: he has retreated and has ordered the rear guard to light fires and make noise in order to deceive us.”::1889-08-01
Nelsonia::68458.56411437079::All the while he was in the battery by the cannon, as often happens, he had never stopped hearing the sounds of the officers’ voices, talking in the lean-to, but had not understood a single word of what they were saying. Suddenly the sound of voices from the lean-to struck him with such soul-felt tones that he involuntarily began to listen.::1984-01-09
Weedonville::485677.64013412007::Because of the self-assurance with which he spoke, no one could make out whether what he had said was very clever or very stupid. He was wearing a dark green tailcoat, trousers the color of cuisse de nymphe effray233;e, §42 as he said himself, stockings and shoes.::1811-07-16
Oak Hall::610083.8354615422::Bonaparte’s adjutant galloped off at full speed with this threatening letter to Murat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting his generals, moved with all his guards to the field of battle, fearing to let the ready victim slip, while Bagration’s four-thousand-man division cheerfully lit campfires, dried out, warmed up, cooked kasha for the first time in three days, and not one man in the division knew or thought about what lay ahead of him.::1919-11-09
Kennewick::218243.311751791::After dinner Speransky’s daughter and her governess got up. Speransky stroked his daughter with his white hand and kissed her. And this gesture seemed unnatural to Prince Andrei.::1899-05-02
Brosville::349730.038568113::Petya, her brother, was also upstairs: he and his tutor were preparing fireworks to be set off at night.::1982-11-25
Basye::182518.6672924983::“Countess…” said Denisov, with lowered eyes and a guilty look, and he was about to say something more, but faltered.::1879-06-17
Paytes::476354.1186700745::“Ah, it’s you, very glad, very glad to see you,” he said anyhow, smiling and going up to him. But Rostov had noticed his first reaction.::1889-07-04
New Kent::632792.2512010827::“Mama, I want him.  Why am I going to waste like this, mama?…” Her voice broke off, tears flowed from her eyes, and to conceal them she quickly turned and left the room. She went to the sitting room, stood, thought, and went to the maids’ quarters. There an old maidservant was grumbling at a young girl who came in breathless from the cold outside.::1882-09-25
Mountain View::841576.542804262::“Have these gentlemen looked after and taken to my bivouac; have my doctor Larrey examine their wounds. Good-bye, Prince Repnin.” And, touching up his horse, he galloped on.::1865-09-15
Gladys::654655.8224196786::Nikolai dismounted and stood by the hounds with Natasha and Petya, who joined him, waiting for news of how the matter would end. The hunter who had been fighting left the edge of the woods with the fox strapped to his saddle and rode over to his young master. He took off his hat while still some distance away and tried to speak respectfully; but he was pale, breathless, and his face was angry. He had a black eye, but he probably did not know it.::1913-05-10
Volens::988442.9191142749::Princess Anna Mikhailovna mixed into the conversation, clearly wishing to show her connections and her knowledge of all the circumstances of society.::1873-06-03
Hiwassee::647525.0608743379::And Pierre, trying fearfully to recall whether he had done anything reprehensible, blushed and looked around him. It seemed to him that everyone knew what had happened to him as well as he did.::1895-05-17
Hewlett::648359.1552061936::“Ah, I’m so afraid for her, so afraid!” said the countess, forgetting whom she was talking with. Her maternal intuition told her that there was too much of something in Natasha, and that because of it she would not be happy. Natasha had not yet finished singing when the enraptured fourteen-year-old Petya came running into the room with news that the mummers had come.::1917-08-09
Napa::454032.43754583655::“So you never noticed before how beautiful I am?” H233;l232;ne seemed to say. “You never noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a woman who could belong to anyone, even you,” said her gaze. And at that moment Pierre felt that H233;l232;ne not only could, but must be his wife, that it could not be otherwise.::1935-05-24
Tustin::742054.0739238168::“No, I’m going, I’m certainly going,” Natasha said resolutely. “Danilo, order horses saddled for us, and have Mikhailo ride out with my pack,” she turned to the huntsman.::1852-01-07
Dranesville::974715.1469996119::“Ah! ch232;re!…Ah! Marie!…”  the two women suddenly began to speak and then laughed. “J’ai rev233; cette nuit…” “Vous ne nous attendiez donc pas?…” “Ah, Marie, vous avez maigri…” “Et vous avez repris…” *158::1919-05-10
Brentsville::897597.8944690727::“I’ll have the horse brought, then,” said Rostov, wishing to be rid of Telyanin, and he went to give orders for the horse to be brought.::2000-05-05
Lynchburg::654214.8995974258::“The enemy has put out his fires, and a continual noise is heard from his camp,” he said. “What does that mean? Either he is retreating, which is the one thing we should fear, or he is changing his position” (he smiled). “But even if he takes up a position in Thuerassa, he is only saving us a great deal of trouble, and all orders, to the smallest detail, remain the same.”::1838-04-08
Lawrence::475401.6952839073::“Beyond the Niemen?” Napoleon repeated. “So now you want me to withdraw beyond the Niemen? Merely the Niemen?” Napoleon repeated, looking straight at Balashov.::1856-04-22
Hollymead::86838.6474201407::“Et moi qui ne me doutais pas!…”  exclaimed Princess Marya. “Ah! Andr233;, je ne vous voyais pas.” ‡160::1867-01-14
Wellington::669422.3254621249::To the left below, in the fog, exchanges of fire between unseen troops could be heard. There, it seemed to Prince Andrei, the battle would concentrate, there an obstacle would be encountered, and “it’s there that I’ll be sent with a brigade or division, and there, with a standard in my hand, I’ll go forward and crush everything ahead of me.”::1800-05-14
Deerfield Beach::276817.7911146212::And, having dismissed Mavrusha, Natasha went through the reception room to the front hall. An old servant and two young ones were playing cards. They broke off their game and stood up when the young lady came in. “What shall I do with them?” thought Natasha.::1926-11-18
Plum Creek::598520.4894706894::He laughed drily, coldly, unpleasantly, as he always laughed—only with his mouth, not with his eyes.::1864-07-20
South Chesconessex::201166.31777756888::Four years earlier, having met a German friend in the stalls of a Moscow theater, Berg had pointed Vera Rostov out to him and said in German: “Das soll mein Weib werden” *344 —and from that moment on had determined to marry her. Now, in Petersburg, having figured out the Rostovs’ situation, he decided that the time had come and proposed.::1820-04-12
Brooklyn Park::566274.8311886867::“Mon prince, ‘errare humanum est,’ mais…” ‡96 the doctor replied, swallowing his r ’s and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent.::1990-04-04

Parma::906633.6982824306::In the second category Pierre included himself and similar brothers, seeking, vacillating, who had not yet found in Masonry a straight and clear path, but hoped to find one.::1873-05-19
Alameda::341956.2128176493::And, patting Berg on the shoulder, he got up, wishing to end the conversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that unless he knew for certain what Vera’s dowry would be, and received at least part of what was allotted her in advance, he would be forced to renounce.::1887-08-21
Fork Union::469549.22512673715::“However, I think Mikhail Ilarionovich has come out,” said Prince Andrei. “I wish you luck and success, gentlemen,” he added and left, after shaking hands with Dolgorukov and Bilibin.::1958-12-15
Marshall::621496.9700216101::Rostov, standing in the front ranks of Kutuzov’s army, which the sovereign rode up to first, had the same feeling that was experienced by every man in that army—a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud awareness of strength, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this solemnity.::1842-12-01
Buckner::395617.21076078515::The sovereign’s indecision lasted only a moment. The sovereign’s foot, in the narrow, sharp toe of its boot, as they wore them then, touched the belly of the bobtailed bay mare he was riding; the sovereign’s hand in its white glove picked up the reins, and he set off, accompanied by a disorderly swaying sea of adjutants. He rode further and further, stopping by other regiments, and at last Rostov could only see his white plumes beyond the suite that surrounded the emperors.::1980-06-10
Annandale::889771.824508857::“Well, thank God, Princess,” Marya Bogdanovna said, without quickening her pace. “You young girls oughtn’t to know about these things.”::1952-01-04
Gasburg::870691.1647158309::“No need, no need…” the prince said quickly and, putting his feet into his slippers and his arms through the sleeves of his dressing gown, he went to the sofa on which he slept.::1992-02-15
Chino Hills::90795.77627131341::While the couples were being placed and the musicians were tuning up, Pierre sat with his little partner. Natasha was perfectly happy: she was dancing with a grown-up  who had come from abroad.  She sat in full view of everyone and talked to him like a grown-up. In her hand was a fan which a young lady had given her to hold. And, assuming a most worldly pose (God knows where and when she had learned it), fanning herself and smiling through the fan, she talked with her partner.::1872-03-03
Mechanicsburg::115917.81883599616::Dolokhov, now changed into a gray soldier’s greatcoat, did not wait to be called out. The trim figure of the fair-haired soldier with clear blue eyes stepped from the line. He went up to the commander in chief and presented arms.::1983-07-20
Springdale::307311.2195246749::The sovereigns got on their horses and left. The Preobrazhensky battalion, breaking ranks, mingled with the French guards and sat down at the tables prepared for them.::1881-11-04
Linville::20173.276487153726::“Really! Swear to God!” replied Natasha, straightening a strand of stiff hair that had come loose from her friend’s braid.::1876-03-11
Laurel::420510.3134903465::“I need a lot, Count, I need five hundred rubles.” And, taking out a cambric handkerchief, she began rubbing her husband’s waistcoat.::1849-06-23
Bloomington::320487.983518033::Pierre did not have the practical tenacity that would have given him the possibility of undertaking the business directly, and therefore he did not like it, and only tried to pretend to the steward that he was occupied with it. And the steward tried to pretend to the count that he considered this occupation quite useful for the master and inconvenient for himself.::1997-04-02
East Highland Park::841414.3535863749::Rostov was very happy in the love that was shown him, but the first moment of their meeting had been so blissful that his present happiness seemed too little to him, and he kept waiting for more, and more, and more.::1887-05-07
Palmyra::671099.9458982442::Ilya Andreich approved of this suggestion, grasping its good sense at once. If the old man softens, it will be all the better if they come to him in Moscow or Bald Hills afterwards; if not, then they could marry against his will only in Otradnoe.::1878-12-07
Walters::489077.7350464257::“It’s your prot233;g233;e, your dear Anna Mikhailovna, whom I wouldn’t have as a housemaid—that vile, loathsome woman.”::1858-06-04

Bellflower::439632.86998340033::Rostov took the purse in his hands and looked at it, and at the money that was in it, and at Telyanin. The lieutenant glanced about, as was his habit, and suddenly seemed to become very merry.::1952-05-11
Warfield::329830.9740826205::M233;tivier, shrugging his shoulders, went over to Mlle Bourienne, who, hearing the shouting, had come running from the neighboring room.::1920-03-02
Cumberland::523497.66686756274::Nesvitsky turned and saw, fifteen paces away, separated from him by the living mass of moving infantry, red, black, disheveled, his peaked cap pushed back, his dolman thrown dashingly over his shoulder—Vaska Denisov.::1973-04-20
Rockdell::282766.5051275159::Bogucharovo lay in flat, unattractive country covered with fields and first- and second-growth stands of fir and birch. The manor stood at the end of a village that stretched along the high road, behind a newly dug, well-filled pond, its banks not yet overgrown with grass, in the middle of a young woods, amidst which stood a few big pines.::1990-02-20
Dooms::805456.5519024291::“Very good, very good! We’ll discuss it all,” said Prince Andrei. “Just let me report about this gentleman, and then I’m yours.”::1802-11-21
Racine::14869.157485774998::“I can’t help loving the light, it’s not my fault. And I’m very happy. Do you understand me? I know you’re glad for me.”::1889-12-14
Milpitas::209251.5621090276::He covered the girls’ albums with verses and music, and, without taking leave of any of his acquaintances, having finally sent off the entire forty-three thousand and received Dolokhov’s receipt, left at the end of November to catch up with his regiment, which was already in Poland.::1992-01-12
Baskerville::899800.0672276358::“No, what is there to talk about!” said Pierre. “It makes no difference…So, are we ready?” he added. “Only tell me, where am I to go and where am I to shoot?” he said with an unnaturally meek smile. He took the pistol in his hands and began asking how to pull the trigger, because until then he had never handled a pistol, something he did not want to admit. “Ah, yes, like that, I know, I just forgot,” he said.::1900-10-20
Auburn::223184.51031909304::Pierre understood that Boris wanted to change the subject, and, agreeing with him, began to explain the advantages and disadvantages of the Boulogne undertaking.::1813-12-03
New Church::561439.059470819::On all sides one saw wet, sad-faced officers, who seemed to be looking for something, and soldiers, who were dragging doors, benches, and fences from the village.::1863-07-17
Rileyville::258607.16129326622::The uncle dismounted by the porch of his small wooden house sunk in a garden, and, looking over his domestics, shouted peremptorily that the superfluous people should take themselves off and everything necessary should be done to receive the guests and the hunt.::1948-04-11
Greenbriar::105853.85963782745::He spilled the fire, smashed the pipe, and threw it away. Then he paused and suddenly glanced merrily at Rostov with his shining black eyes.::1909-11-11
Pharr::315427.9773751557::“Or at least twenty thousand, Count,” he added, “and then a promissory note for only sixty thousand.”::1816-01-06

Scranton::666320.0646230864::“Allez voir, mon cher, si la troisi232;me division a d233;pass233; le village. Dites-lui de s’arr234;ter et d’attendre mes ordres.” †267::1925-06-13

Fairview::453528.5294443856::He possessed in the highest degree that practical tenacity, lacking in Pierre, which kept things in motion without any big gestures and efforts on his part.::1803-05-08
Wylliesburg::280113.7324611629::“Well, that’s it,” thought Rostov, “he wants to test me!” His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face. “Let him see whether I’m a coward,” he thought.::1967-12-02
Dahlgren::268998.2114829442::“I’m not afraid of anything,” said Sonya. “May I go now?” She got up. They told Sonya where the barn was, how she should stand silently and listen, and gave her her coat. She threw it over her head and glanced at Nikolai.::1811-09-20
Stuarts Draft::102740.43919562726::“Yes, wait,” said Denisov, glancing at the officers, and, taking his papers from under the pillow, he went to the window, where there was an inkstand, and sat down to write.::1822-06-16

Plymouth::443996.6083690016::Sonya fell to thinking. The question of how to write to Nicolas, and whether she should write to him, was a question that tormented her. Now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero, would it be right on her part to remind him of herself and, as it were, of the commitment he had taken upon himself in her regard.::1996-01-14
Middlebrook::431207.20074058615::Speransky did not shift his eyes from one face to another, as one does involuntarily when entering a large company, and he was in no hurry to speak. He spoke softly, with assurance that he would be heard, and looked only at the person with whom he was speaking.::1858-09-09
Oakton::565825.7923593541::Natasha pulled him down to her and kissed his face all over, then jumped back and, holding the skirt of his Hungarian jacket, hopped up and down in one place like a little goat and shrieked piercingly.::1972-06-11

Pantops::926586.2168836227::Dolokhov gravely began to deal. Oh, how Rostov hated at that moment those reddish hands, with their short fingers and the hair sticking out from the cuffs, which had him in their power…He won the ten.::1860-06-10

Baileys Crossroads::727701.7849983476::Just as Boris came in, Prince Andrei, narrowing his eyes disdainfully (with that particular air of polite weariness which says clearly that, were it not my duty, I would not talk with you for a minute), was listening to an old Russian general with decorations, who, drawn up almost on tiptoe, with an obsequious soldierly expression on his purple face, was reporting something to him.::1933-08-07
Goode::903726.9395597485::The next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter; but she noticed that over dinner he ordered the food served starting with Mlle Bourienne.

Monroe::999923.8594672395::“She and Pyotr Ilyich are standing across from the Zharovo thicket,” Semyon replied, smiling. “She may be a lady, but she knows a lot about hunting.”::1975-09-15

Five Mile Fork::370152.179244959::“That I don’t know. Eh?” said Anatole, taking heart as Pierre overcame his wrath. “That I don’t know and don’t want to know,” he said, not looking at Pierre and with a slight trembling of his lower jaw, “but you have spoken to me in such words—‘mean’ and the like—as I, comme un homme d’honneur, †388 will not allow to anyone.”::1854-08-17
Lake Charles::759201.0697102788::“For God’s sake, what are you…If you tell, you’re my enemy,” Natasha began. “You want me to be unhappy, you want them to separate us…”::1849-10-21

Woodbridge::397089.87810223404::Prince Vassily pondered and winced. Anna Mikhailovna understood that he feared to find in her a rival over Count Bezukhov’s will. She hastened to reassure him.::1880-08-03
Alton::91182.38634726283::And Boris, obviously relieving himself of a painful duty, getting out of an awkward situation himself, and putting another man in one, again became perfectly pleasant.::1909-06-03

Starkey::3926.2624985529906::“But what is there to say about me?” asked Pierre, spreading his mouth into a carefree, merry smile. “What am I? Je suis un b226;tard! ” And he suddenly flushed crimson. One could see that it had cost him great effort to say that. “Sans nom, sans fortune †80 …And what, really…” But he did not say what really.  “I’m free so far, and I feel fine. Only I have no idea where to make my start. I seriously wanted to ask your advice.”::1999-03-24

Trammel::198924.7893379472::Prince Andrei, looking straight ahead, listened silently to Pierre’s speech. A few times he asked Pierre to repeat words he had not heard because of the noise of the carriage.

Sebrell::26099.410939873334::“Listen, Prince,” she said, “I’ve never asked you for anything, and never will, I’ve never reminded you of my father’s friendship for you. But now, I adjure you in God’s name, do this for my son, and I will consider you my benefactor,” she added hastily. “No, don’t be angry, but promise me. I asked Golitsyn and he refused.

Seeing Bolkonsky, Kutuzov softened the angry and caustic expression of his gaze, as if aware that his adjutant was not to blame for what was going on. And, without answering the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolkonsky:::1908-05-16
Jeffersonton::664172.6731851065::“Ma bonne amie, je crains que le fruschtique  (comme dit  Foka, the cook) de ce matin ne m’aie pas fait du mal.” *282::1890-09-02

South Riding::185193.86514500226::Princess Marya looked at him with astonishment. She did not understand how it was even possible to ask about it. Pierre went into the study.

Bull Run::310042.36189311376::Only to the old countess, in bed at night, would Natasha have been able to tell everything she thought.

North Shore::613614.9033966522::Princess Marya looked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand what made him smile. Everything her father did evoked an awe in her which was not subject to discussion.::1931-02-18

Motley::304091.6790807299::Natasha, no less proud of wearing a long gown for the first time, at a real ball, was still happier. The two girls wore white muslin gowns with pink ribbons.::1871-12-18

Laurel Hill::851647.1978042641::He sometimes comforted himself with the thought that he happened to be leading this life just so, in the meantime; but then he would be horrified by another thought, that it was just so, in the meantime, that so many people had entered this life, this club, as he had, with all their teeth and hair, and come out of it with not a single tooth or hair left.::1827-01-11
Paint Bank::115354.98654006505::Oh, how that third had vibrated, and how touched was something that was best in Rostov’s soul.

Jonesboro::993583.85092224::The hussar only sighed, making no reply, and cleared his throat angrily. Down the line of hussars the hoofbeats of a trotting horse were heard, and suddenly out of the night mist, looking like a huge elephant, emerged the figure of a hussar sergeant.::1988-04-17
Aquia Harbour::840567.7155738203::The steward, a very stupid but cunning man, understood the intelligent but na239;ve count perfectly and played with him as with a toy.

Franklin::717939.335584971::COUNT NIKOL193;I ILY205;CH (Nik243;lushka, Nik243;lenka, Nikol225;shka, K243;lya, Nicolas, Coco), their elder son::1961-09-02

Iowa City::322664.848341046::Speransky did not shift his eyes from one face to another, as one does involuntarily when entering a large company, and he was in no hurry to speak.

Crozet::138574.4289837899::The unpleasant impression, like the remains of fog in a clear sky, passed over the emperor’s young and happy face and disappeared.

I can’t command my feelings,” he said to himself. “If I love Sonya, my feeling is stronger and higher than everything for me.”::1856-12-13
Ruckersville::526165.3225071571::“And the f234;te at the British ambassador’s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance,” said the prince. “My daughter will come to fetch me and take me there.”::1845-11-22
Arcola::665584.7638807095::But it was she, in a new dress, unfamiliar to him, which must have been made in his absence. Everyone let him go, and he ran to her. When they came together, she fell on his breast, weeping. She could not lift her face, and only pressed it to the cold cords of his Hungarian jacket. Denisov, unnoticed by anyone, came into the room, stood there, and rubbed his eyes looking at them.::1830-01-18
Dundas::326768.05714492354::“Zakhar is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the left?” Nikolai wondered. “Are we driving to the Melyukovs’? Can this be Melyukovka?

Southfield::633952.6598089688::“What’s the matter with her?” Pierre wondered, glancing at her. She was sitting beside her sister at the tea table and replied reluctantly, without looking at him, to something Boris said as he sat down by her. Having gone through a whole suit and taken five tricks, much to his partner’s delight, Pierre, who heard an exchange of greetings and the sound of someone’s footsteps coming into the room as he was gathering in his tricks, looked at her again.::1870-07-11

North Springfield::814922.4774126326::“Who looks after the patients here?” he asked the assistant. Just then a commissariat soldier, a hospital attendant, came out of the next room and, stamping his feet, snapped to attention in front of Rostov.::1927-05-22

Chatmoss::624960.5832866203::In the course of their long conversation on Wednesday evening, Speransky said more than once: “Among us  everything that lies outside the general level of inveterate habit is considered…” or, with a smile: “But we  want the wolves well-fed and the sheep safe…” or: “They  cannot understand it…” And all that with an expression which said: “We, you and I, understand what they  are and who we  are.”::2003-09-02
Decatur::938313.1267274857::“Well, my dear,” Prince Vassily said jokingly, “say ‘yes’ to me, and I’ll write to her myself, and we can kill the fatted calf.”7 But Prince Vassily had no time to finish his joke, because Pierre, with a fury in his face that was reminiscent of his father, without looking his interlocutor in the eye, said in a quiet whisper:::2012-04-05

Union Hall::463755.00720809103::She was reading and glancing at the sleeping Natasha, searching her face for an explanation of what she was reading and unable to find it. The face was gentle, meek, and happy. Clutching her chest to keep from choking, Sonya, pale and termbling with fear and agitation, sat in an armchair and dissolved in tears.::1931-02-14
Hurley::821295.0509824893::“Faites avancer celles de la r233;serve,” ‡273 said Napoleon, and, riding on a few paces, he stopped over Prince Andrei, who lay on his back, the staff of the standard fallen beside him (the standard had already been taken as a trophy by the French).::1986-06-15
Hartfield::228620.76762670337::The princess said nothing. All that could be heard were the sounds of the efforts of the struggle over the portfolio. It was clear that if she did start to talk, it would not be flattering for Anna Mikhailovna. Anna Mikhailovna held on tight, but in spite of that her voice retained all its sweet, drawling softness.::1835-11-20
Apple Valley::854617.0176027953::“Gently, gently, can’t you do it gently?” said the sovereign, clearly suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode off.::1833-12-04

Max Meadows::735027.2855444987::“Can it be me, that ‘baby girl’ (as everybody said of me),” thought Natasha, “can it be that from this moment on I’m a wife,  equal to this strange, dear, intelligent man, whom even my father respects? Can it be true? Can it be true that now there is to be no more toying with life, that I’m grown up now, that responsibility is laid upon me now for my every deed and word? Ah, what was it he asked me?”::2002-03-06
Bismarck::320399.01338060986::The postilion touched up the horses, and the wheels of the carriage rumbled. Prince Ippolit laughed fitfully, standing on the porch and waiting for the viscount, whom he had promised to take home.::1925-05-20
Belmont Estates::726646.7086373827::“Attendez, je n’ai pas fini…”  he said to Prince Andrei, seizing him by the arm. “Je suppose que l’intervention sera plus forte que la non-intervention.

Bellamy::771336.8388070907::“Hold on now, master,” he said. The troikas flew on still faster side by side, and faster moved the legs of the galloping horses. Nikolai began to pull ahead. Zakhar, without changing the position of his outstretched arms, raised the hand that held the reins.::1830-04-04
York Haven Anchorage::195782.50427090848::Rostov, avoiding Denisov’s eyes, began to button his jacket, buckled on his saber, and put on his peaked cap.::1887-02-03
Missoula::78170.99773740688::Natasha, no less proud of wearing a long gown for the first time, at a real ball, was still happier. The two girls wore white muslin gowns with pink ribbons.::1870-05-20
Waukesha::949457.7059766658::“If you won’t take money from me as a friend, you’ll offend me. I really have got it,” Rostov repeated.::1990-06-04
Tuckahoe::816767.604191372::The hunters took the fox from the dogs, and stood dismounted for a long time without strapping it on. The horses, their bridles free and their saddles jutting up, stood nearby, and the dogs lay down. The hunters waved their arms and did something with the fox. The sound of a horn rang out from there—the conventional signal of a fight.::1819-10-13
Rancho Cordova::886967.8483294507::“How shall I tell you,” Natasha replied. “I was in love with Boris, with my teacher, with Denisov, but this is not the same at all. I feel peaceful, firm. I know that there’s no one better than he, and I feel so calm, so good now. Not at all like before…”::1826-02-09
Jefferson::118011.00528886255::“If you, my dear sir,” he began in a shrill voice, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, “wish to be a buffoon,  I cannot prevent you from being one; but I announce to you that the next time you dare  to clown in my presence, I will teach you how to behave.”::1914-11-04

Lafayette::111280.5617012409::“Yes. It’s past nine,” Natasha’s voice replied, and in the next room the rustle of starched skirts, whispers, and the laughter of girls’ voices were heard, and through the slightly open door flashed something light blue, ribbons, dark hair, and merry faces. This was Natasha, with Sonya and Petya, who had come to see whether he had gotten up.::1955-02-14
Lancaster::835167.5504474613::“I have it from good sources that the dowager empress is taking a lively interest in this whole affair. You know, she’s very favorable to H233;l232;ne.”::1948-03-08
Cave Spring::585535.764808145::Supposing that such a reception could be given him only because Davout did not know that he was the emperor Alexander’s adjutant general and even his representative before Napoleon, Balashov hastened to inform him of his rank and purpose. Contrary to his expectation, Davout, having heard Balashov out, became still more stern and rude.::2005-05-18
Lauderhill::161030.7082907728::“I just called on the countess, your spouse, and was so unlucky as to have my request go unfulfilled; I hope that with you, Count, I shall have more luck,” he said, smiling.::1876-07-06
Vesuvius::51984.85449634016::“Your father, a man of the old days, obviously stands higher than our contemporaries who condemn this measure so much, though it merely restores natural justice.”::1959-10-21
Flagstaff::375116.2920309246::The reason for the confusion was that, while the Austrian cavalry was moving on the left flank, the superior officers decided that our center was too far from the right flank, and the entire cavalry was ordered to cross over to the right. Several thousand cavalry were advancing ahead of the infantry, and the infantry was forced to wait.::2002-02-20

Ararat::722295.9121292684::“Mama, the toque more to one side,” said Natasha. “I’ll re-pin it,” and she rushed forward, and the sewing girls, who had no time to follow her, tore off a piece of gauze.::1935-05-15
Alleghany::819740.2564118763::To see things like that, our eye must be directed by passion. For it is passion that by its flash illuminates an object, intensifying its appearance.::1968-06-23
Pawtucket::173815.26479427645::“Hm! this excellence  is a little brat…I solicited his post for him in the ministry,” the prince said peevishly. “And why the son, I cannot comprehend. Princess Lizaveta Karlovna and Princess Marya may know, but I don’t know why they’re bringing this son here. I have no need of him.” And he looked at his blushing daughter.::1905-11-20

Jolivue::416334.11971261824::“Marya Lvovna Karagin with daughter!” the countess’s enormous footman announced in a bass voice, coming to the door of the drawing room. The countess pondered and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husband’s portrait on it.::1955-12-06
Nokesville::785417.8385312654::Berg put on the cleanest of frock coats, with not a spot or speck on it, fluffed up his whiskers in front of the mirror, as Alexander Pavlovich wore them, and, assuring himself from Rostov’s glance that his frock coat had been noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.::1905-08-25
Cherry Hill::943048.7840461507::“Yes, but entre nous, ”*85 said the countess, “it’s a pretext. He’s come, essentially, to see Count Kirill Vladimirovich, having learned that he was so poorly.”::1999-06-17

Hollins::120786.33209121315::Princess Marya shrugged her shoulders, but took the glass obediently and, calling to the nanny, began to administer the medicine. The baby cried and wheezed. Prince Andrei, wincing, clutched his head, went out, and sat on a sofa in the next room.::1878-01-03
Merrimac::148628.6852852643::Kutuzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes flashed over his face as when he had turned away from Captain Timokhin. He turned away and winced, as if wishing to express thereby that all that Dolokhov had said to him and all that he could say had long, long been known to him, that it all bored him, and that it was all by no means what was needed. He turned away and made for the coach.::1899-08-23

Atlantic::223389.17196836104::“I know no one can help if nature doesn’t help,” Prince Andrei said, visibly embarrassed. “I agree that only one case in a million ends badly, but it’s her and my fantasy. People have said things to her, she’s had dreams, and she’s afraid.”::1800-07-02
Lynwood::676309.1862571314::The third time the rhetor came back sooner and asked Pierre whether he was still firm in his intention and was determined to submit himself to everything that was demanded of him.::1866-10-22
Bacova::401336.10103235784::“She’s ravishing, isn’t she?” she said to Pierre, pointing to the majestic beauty as she sailed off. “Et quelle tenue! ‡228 What tact for such a young girl, and what a masterly ability to behave! It comes from the heart. Happy the one to whom she will belong! With her even the most unworldly husband will involuntarily and effortlessly occupy a brilliant place in society. Isn’t that so?

Chamberlayne::765691.095671669::“Well, that’s it, that’s it,” the general said angrily, taking the glass from his eye and shrugging his shoulders, “that’s it, they’re going to fire on the crossing. And what are they dawdling for?”::1927-05-09
Mount Vernon::942590.0136851234::Prince Andrei could see that the officer was in the sort of drunken fit of senseless rage when people do not know what they are saying. He could see that his intercession for the doctor’s wife in the kibitka was replete with what he feared most in the world, with what is known as ridicule. *216 But his instinct told him otherwise. Before the officer had time to finish his last words, Prince Andrei, his face disfigured with rage, rode up to him and raised his whip:::1885-02-12
Snowville::692120.7541891712::Natasha involuntarily gazed at that neck, the shoulders, the pearls, the coiffure, and admired the beauty of the shoulders and pearls.

Yorktown::875838.7507657966::Prince Ippolit went over to the little princess and, bringing his face down close to hers, began saying something to her in a half whisper. Two footmen, one the princess’s, the other his, waiting for them to finish talking, stood with shawl and redingote and listened to their French talk, which they could not understand, with such faces as if they understood what was being said but did not want to show it. The princess, as usual, talked smilingly and listened laughingly.::1973-01-09
Lake Ridge::890584.6274509459::Balashov rode on, supposing from Murat’s words that he would quite soon be introduced to Napoleon himself.

Loch Lomond::658081.6699960069::“Ah, that’s terrible, terrible!” said Pierre. “Only I don’t understand how one can live with such thoughts.

I don’t eat then, don’t wash…well, how is it with you…”::1912-06-03
Riverdale::779854.4702085621::“Gentlemen, the disposition for tomorrow, for today even (because it’s already past twelve), cannot be changed,” he said. “You have heard it, and we will all do our duty.

Cripple Creek::196447.1467151032::“That is just why I do not begin, Sire,” Kutuzov said in a ringing voice, as if to forestall the possibility of not being heard, and again something twitched in his face. “I do not begin, Sire, because we are not on parade and not on the Tsaritsyn Field,” he uttered clearly and distinctly.::1825-10-05

Neither Bennigsen nor the sovereign was there; but Chernyshov, the imperial adjutant, received Bolkonsky and announced to him that the sovereign had ridden with General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci to make a second round of the fortifications of the Drissa camp, the suitability of which had become a subject of strong doubts.::1981-11-14

As soon as the king began to speak loudly and quickly, all his kingly dignity instantly left him, and, not noticing it himself, he went over to his proper tone of good-natured familiarity. He placed his hand on the withers of Balashov’s horse.::1814-07-09
Ruther Glen::417912.9029619948::The smile vanished from Speranksy’s white face, and his physiognomy gained much from it. He probably found Prince Andrei’s thought interesting.::1804-01-04

Independent Hill::47500.08106020298::He was clearly so preoccupied that he even forgot to be respectful with the commander in chief: he interrupted him, spoke quickly, unclearly, not looking into his interlocutor’s eyes, not answering the questions put to him, was covered with mud, and looked pitiful, exhausted, disconcerted, and at the same time presumptuous and proud.::1901-08-24
North Richland Hills::924940.4712184311::When Gavrilo came to report to Marya Dmitrievna that the people who had come had run away, she frowned, stood up, and, putting her hands behind her back, paced the rooms for a long time, reflecting on what to do. Towards midnight, feeling the key in her pocket, she went to Natasha’s room. Sonya sat weeping in the corridor.::2000-07-06
Maple Grove::725622.9327381696::Only Countess Elena Vassilievna, considering the company of some sort of Bergs humiliating to her, could be so cruel as to refuse such an invitation. Berg explained so clearly why he wished to gather a small and good company at his place, and why this would be a pleasure for him, and why he would be sorry to spend money on cards or on something bad, but on good company he was ready to suffer the expense, that Pierre could not refuse and promised to come.::1895-04-14

Inclining his head, he listened and frowned silently to his master. “They’ve struck on the litter…” he whispered, “they’re heading straight for the Lyadovsky knoll.”::1940-11-14
Roseville Park::460145.733575233::Old Prince Nikolai Andreich Bolkonsky received a letter from Prince Vassily in December 1805, informing him of his arrival together with his son.

Cedar Park::502423.29904086725::“He’s a man in a gray frock coat, who wished very much that I would say ‘Your Majesty’ to him, but, to his regret, did not receive any titles from me. That’s what he’s like, and nothing more,” Dolgorukov replied, glancing at Bilibin with a smile.::1888-09-05
Woodbury::72531.13929492772::“She and Pyotr Ilyich are standing across from the Zharovo thicket,” Semyon replied, smiling. “She may be a lady, but she knows a lot about hunting.”::1883-03-08
Stanton::274747.1072825242::Prince Nikolai Andreich became more animated and voiced his way of thinking about the impending war.::1967-09-18
Holly Oak::671638.0698236653::“Believe me, Princess, I’ll do all I can,” replied Prince Vassily, “but it’s hard for me to ask the sovereign. I’d advise you to turn to Rumyantsev through Prince Golitsyn—that would be smarter.”::1872-03-20

Saint Georges::686636.7713790562::“Le vicomte a 233;t233; personellement connu de monseigneur,”  Anna Pavlovna whispered to one. “Le vicomte est un parfait conteur,”  she said to another. “Comme on voit l’homme de la bonne compagnie,” †35 she said to a third; and the viscount was presented to the company in a most refined and advantageous light, like a roast beef on a hot platter sprinkled with herbs.::2007-08-10
Edgemoor::61824.87527422253::There was a thaw, mud, cold, the ice on the river broke up, the roads became impassable; for several days provisions had not been issued either to the horses or to the men. Since transport became impossible, men scattered over the abandoned, desolate villages looking for potatoes, but found little even of them.::1998-08-05
Dothan::236303.6151058464::“Typhus, my lad. Anyone who comes here is a dead man. There’s only the two of us, me and Makeev” (he pointed to the assistant) “still hanging on here. Five of our fellow doctors have already died. A new one comes, after one little week he’s finished,” the doctor said with visible pleasure. “Prussian doctors were invited, but our allies don’t find it to their liking.”::1957-10-11
Ogletown::767520.476694574::Though Prince Vassily listened to the elderly lady reluctantly and almost impolitely, and even showed impatience, she smiled at him gently and touchingly, and even took him by the arm to keep him from walking away.::1953-06-01
Mount Vernon::612186.3778463886::“Look, Annette, ne me jouez pas un mauvais tour, ” she turned to the hostess. “Vouz m’avez 233;crit que c’233;tait une toute petite soir233;e; voyez comme je suis attif233;e. ”‡29::1957-08-02

Marshallton::301368.95798340766::Nesvitsky was there as an old member of the club. Pierre, who, on his wife’s orders, had let his hair grow long and removed his spectacles, was fashionably dressed, but walked about the rooms with a sad and dejected air. As everywhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of people who bowed before his wealth, and he treated them with a habitual lordliness and absentminded disdain.::1923-12-09
Waterloo::104432.40199854231::“Ah, here she is,” said Ilya Andreich, seeing Natasha come in. “Well, sit here with me.” But Natasha stopped by her mother, looking around, as if searching for something.::1917-05-10

Redondo Beach::691571.3686640803::He wanted to resolve it, but felt with terror that in this case he lacked the resolve that he knew he had and that indeed was in him. Pierre was one of those people who are strong only when they feel themselves perfectly pure. And since the day when he had been possessed by that feeling of desire which he had experienced over the snuffbox at Anna Pavlovna’s, an unconscious feeling of guilt on account of that attraction had paralyzed his resolve.::1935-07-15
Jacksonville::745618.1090239045::“192; celui qui s’est le plus vaillamment conduit dans cette derni232;re guerre,” †334 Napoleon added, rapping out every syllable with a calm and assurance that Rostov found outrageous, and looking over the ranks of Russian soldiers standing at attention before him, still presenting arms and looking fixedly at the face of their emperor.::1931-01-11
Westover Hills::329241.3458022314::Prince Andrei, who, to complete the trophy of prisoners, was also brought out before the eyes of the emperor, could not fail to attract his attention.

Gaithersburg::380362.9898157842::“That, ma ch232;re,  is a bright idea,” the old count picked up, all aroused. “Let me dress up now, and I’ll go with you. I’ll rouse Pashette, too.”::1900-07-11
Victoria::112278.14806096903::“Vassily Denisov, friend of your son,” he said, introducing himself to the old count, who was looking at him questioningly.::1813-05-14
Riverview::968158.237167654::“Yerzinka! Dearie!” wailed Ilagin in a voice not his own. Yerza did not heed his prayer. At the very moment she was expected to seize the hare, he swerved and flew out to the boundary between the green fields and the stubble. Again Yerza and Milka, like a team of horses, straightened up and sped after the hare; it was easier for him to run along the boundary, and dogs could not close in on him so quickly.::1811-06-03
Centerville::663580.135212212::And the count turned to the chef, who, with an intelligent and respectful face, glanced at the father and son observantly and affectionately.::1875-03-12
Saint Cloud::496916.45482655976::On the third day of Christmas, Nikolai dined at home, which had rarely happened with him recently.

I wish they’d come soon. I hope to become close with her…You’ve known them a long time,” said Princess Marya, “tell me, hand on heart, the whole real truth: what kind of girl is she and how you find her? But the whole truth; because, you understand, Andrei is risking so much in doing this against his father’s will that I’d like to know…”::1960-08-18
Minquadale::432426.6727194237::“Why are you silent, mon cousin? ” the princess suddenly shouted so loudly that the people in the drawing room heard and were frightened by her voice. “Why are you silent, when here God knows who allows herself to interfere and make scenes on a dying’s man’s threshold? Intriguer!” she whispered spitefully and tugged at the portfolio with all her might, but Anna Mikhailovna went a few steps so as not to let go of the portfolio, and shifted her grip.::2013-04-08
Greenville::646491.157572115::Princess Marya looked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand what made him smile. Everything her father did evoked an awe in her which was not subject to discussion.::1943-10-02

Rockland::887639.9282495506::“I’ve been sent back to the regiment again on account of this devil, this Mack. An Austrian general made a complaint. I congratulated him on Mack’s arrival…What’s with you, Rostov, come straight from the bathhouse?”::1892-02-24
Camarillo::312921.69554815354::“Ma bonne amie,”  the little princess said on the morning of the nineteenth of March, and her mustached little lip rose by old habit; but as, ever since the day the terrible news had been received, there had been sorrow not only in the smiles, but in the sounds of talk, even in the footsteps in that house, so now the smile of the little princess, who had succumbed to the general mood—though she did not know its cause—was such that it was all the more a reminder of the general sorrow.::2015-01-05
Montchanin::859595.5045558224::“Dieu, quelle virulente sortie!” ‡4 the entering prince replied, not ruffled in the least by such a reception. He was wearing an embroidered court uniform, stockings, shoes, and stars, and had a bright expression on his flat face.::1846-11-25
Georgetown::389895.93628245755::“What can you tell me, Prince, about my Boris?” she said, overtaking him in the front hall. (She pronounced the name Boris with a special emphasis on the o .) “I cannot remain in Petersburg any longer. Tell me, what news can I bring my poor boy?”::1816-01-10
Kent Acres::921657.647678654::But the countess did not want to put the question that way: she did not want a sacrifice from her son, she would have liked to sacrifice herself for him.::1822-12-07
Pleasantville::519550.946328043::When Prince Andrei went to the room prepared for him and lay down on the featherbed and fragrant, warmed-up pillows in clean linen—he felt that the battle, the news of which he had brought, was far, far away from him. The Prussian alliance, the treachery of Austria, the new triumph of Bonaparte, the levee, and the parade, and his reception by the emperor Franz the next day preoccupied him.::1876-12-15
Kenner::229040.86610163376::Having gone less than half a mile at the tail of the column, he stopped by a solitary, deserted house (probably a former tavern), where the road forked. Both roads went down the hill, and troops were marching along both.::1878-07-11
Palo Alto::223610.9591172245::“Why have you come here?” asked the man, turning in the direction of Pierre, who had made a slight rustle. “Why have you, who do not believe in the truths of the light and do not see the light, why have you come here, what do you want from us? Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?”::1926-02-18

Bowers Beach::996853.5188063129::Pierre, as one of the most honored guests, had to sit down to Boston with Ilya Andreevich, the general, and the colonel. At the Boston table, Pierre happened to sit facing Natasha, and he was struck by the odd change that had taken place in her since the day of the ball. Natasha was silent and not only was not as beautiful as she had been at the ball, but would even have been plain if she had not had such look of meekness and indifference to everything.::1933-09-22
Johnson City::788427.7555861518::H233;l232;ne joyfully welcomed Natasha and loudly admired her beauty and her attire. Soon after their arrival, Mlle George left the room to get dressed.

Fairfax::352126.4281118233::The next day the regimental commander summoned Denisov and told him, covering his eyes with his spread fingers: “I look at it this way, I know nothing, and will not start proceedings; but I advise you to go to the staff and settle matters there in the provisions department, and, if possible, to sign a receipt that you received such-and-such provisions; in the contrary case—since the request was put in by the infantry regiment—proceedings could be started and might end badly.”::1884-09-14

Why am I going to waste like this, mama?…” Her voice broke off, tears flowed from her eyes, and to conceal them she quickly turned and left the room.

Lebanon::227840.3588015625::Sonya began to watch her friend still more attentively, and noticed that all through dinner and in the evening, Natasha was in a strange and unnatural state (responded beside the point to questions put to her, began phrases and did not finish them, laughed at everything).::1922-07-22

Oshkosh::500089.3476841689::Since early morning, though it was forbidden to go near the line, the officers had been unable to ward off the curious.

Madera::478750.5651640881::The red Lyubim overtook Milka, precipitously threw himself at the wolf, and seized him by the hindquarters, but in the same second became frightened and jumped over to the other side.

Skokie::6855.119090471984::Sonya walked across the reception room to the pantry with a glass in her hand. Natasha looked at her, at the crack of the pantry door, and it seemed to her that she remembered light coming through the crack in the pantry door and Sonya passing by with a glass. “Yes, that happened, too, in the same way,” Natasha thought.::1897-09-06

South Range::63438.42353865692::“I won’t allow anyone to call me a liar!” cried Rostov. “He called me a liar, and I called him a liar. Let it remain at that.

Sammamish::731875.0853435624::Pierre looked around with tears of joy in his eyes, not knowing how to reply to the congratulations and renewals of acquaintance that surrounded him.

McAllister::29880.69058962495::Pierre hastily went up to her. He thought that she would give him her hand, as always; but, coming close to him, she stopped, breathing heavily and lowering her arms lifelessly, in exactly the same pose in which she came out to the middle of the room to sing, but with quite a different expression.::1874-10-05
Blaine::466071.9434607904::“Know one thing, Masha, I cannot, have not, and never will reproach my wife  for anything, nor can I reproach myself for anything in relation to her; and that will always be so, whatever circumstances I find myself in.

New Munster::975954.3882604834::The princess sank strengthlessly into the armchair next to her father and wept. She now saw her brother at the moment when he had taken leave of her and Liza, with his tender and at the same time arrogant air, saw him at the moment when, tenderly and mockingly, he had put on the little icon. “Did he believe? Did he repent of his unbelief? Was he now there? There, in the place of eternal rest and bliss?” she wondered.::2012-05-03
Gardena::86300.42085247059::The man in tight breeches sang alone, then she sang. Then they both fell silent, music began to play, and the man began to touch the hand of the girl in the white dress with his fingers, evidently waiting for the beat again so as to begin his part with her. They sang together, and everybody in the theater clapped and shouted, and the man and woman on stage, who represented lovers, began to bow, smiling and spreading their arms.::1802-11-24
La Mesa::420943.4193881455::Kutuzov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had said, and sat deep in thought. After five minutes, rocking smoothly on the soft springs of the carriage, Kutuzov turned to Prince Andrei. There was no trace of emotion on his face. With fine irony he questioned the prince about the details of his meeting with the emperor, about the opinions he had heard at court concerning the action at Krems, and about several women of their mutual acquaintance.::1960-08-24
Saint Clair Shores::308417.8786129438::“Oh! it’s terrible to feel myself so much in this man’s power,” thought Rostov. Rostov knew what a blow he would deal to his father, to his mother, in announcing this loss; he knew what happiness it would be to be delivered of it all, and he realized that Dolokhov knew he could deliver him from this shame and grief, but still wanted to play with him as a cat plays with a mouse.::1941-01-15
Saint Joseph::38464.62986652954::Denisov bent over her hand, and she heard strange, incomprehensible sounds. She kissed him on his black, tousled, curly head. At that moment there was a hasty rustle of the countess’s skirts. She went up to them.::1993-07-14
Pontiac::657329.6457191834::“Very sorry you didn’t find me in yesterday. I spent the whole day fussing about with the Germans. Went to see Weyrother to check the disposition. When Germans start being accurate, there’s no end to it!”::1945-09-04
Loretta::212441.02815665654::“Well, Mister Adjutant, what news?” asked the officer, obviously wishing to strike up a conversation.::1900-01-07
Meriden::845414.2476945325::“Ah, what a Daniel Cooper!” said Marya Dmitrievna, letting out a long, deep breath and pushing up her sleeves.::1975-02-05
Dublin::938538.581166454::The night he received this information, Kutuzov sent Bagration’s four-thousand-man vanguard to the right over the hills from the Krems–Znaim to the Vienna–Znaim road. Bagration was to make this march without resting, to stop with his face to Vienna and his back to Znaim, and, if he managed to forestall the French, to detain them there as long as he could. Kutuzov himself started out for Znaim with all the heavy baggage.::1980-02-01
Rusk::653670.495737187::Having come home and told their mother how they spent the time at the Melyukovs’, the girls went to their room. They undressed, but without wiping off their cork mustaches, and sat for a long time talking about their happiness. They talked about how they would live when they were married, how their husbands would be friends, and how they would be happy. Mirrors prepared by Dunyasha since evening stood on Natasha’s table.::1905-09-21
Port Wing::87837.01658290955::The princess saw that her father looked unfavorably on this matter, but at the same moment it occurred to her that her fate in life would be decided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not to see his gaze, under the influence of which she felt she could not think but only obey out of habit, and said:::1977-07-05
Coconut Creek::523604.6222851276::“Here it is, the decisive moment has come! Now it’s my turn,” thought Prince Andrei, and, spurring his horse, he rode up to Kutuzov.::1805-01-13
Casper::334865.77188847464::“J’esp232;re enfin,”  Anna Pavlovna continued, “que 231;a a 233;t233; la goutte d’eau qui fera d233;border le verre. Les souverains ne peuvent plus supporter cet homme, qui menace tout.” *51::1925-06-09
Eagle Lake::594880.1220696508::“I am wounded, I cannot mount a horse, and therefore cannot command an army. You have brought your crushed corps d’arm233;e  to Pultusk: here it is exposed, without firewood, and without forage, and thus in need of help, and since you yourself were in touch with Count Buxh246;wden yesterday, thought should be given to retreating to our border, which should be done today.”::1838-01-04
Heafford Junction::107969.92538696581::“I am not joking with you, kindly keep silent!” shouted Bolkonsky, and, taking Nesvitsky by the arm, he walked away from Zherkov, who was at a loss how to reply.::1963-08-22
Owensboro::849984.4686107343::Besides being taken up with his estates, besides being generally taken up with reading the most varied books, Prince Andrei was taken up at that time with a critical analysis of our last two unfortunate campaigns and with drawing up a project for change in our military regulations and statutes.::1865-10-12
Ocala::28990.498880634987::“But you’re still afraid,” the first, familiar voice went on. “Afraid of the unknown, that’s what. However much we say that the soul will go to heaven…we know that there is no heaven, but only atmosphere.”18::1923-01-25
Chapel Hill::755285.0092238436::“I don’t like to keep company with the Bezukhov woman and I don’t advise it; but if you’ve already promised, go, divert yourself,” she added, addressing Natasha.::1829-11-06
Pflugerville::669741.0430739954::As if by the sounds of the most cheerful music, Rostov felt cheered at heart by these sounds, which he had not heard for so long. Trap-ta-ta-tap!—several shots clapped out, now together, now in rapid succession. Then all fell silent, and then came the crackling again, as if someone was walking on firecrackers.::1899-09-23
Lancaster::88879.5778286473::“Yesterday my brother dined with me—we died of laughter—he eats nothing and sighs after you, my lovely. Il est fou, mais fou amoureux de vous, ma ch232;re. ”*381::1932-04-04
Novi::242819.31667645118::“Your emperor’s orders are carried out in your army, but here,” said Davout, “you should do as you’re told.”::1812-03-12
Great Falls::670409.7974210827::The talk was about Speransky, the news of whose sudden exile and alleged treason had just reached Moscow.17::2007-10-04
Springfield::498660.33205534966::Bagration called to the officer, and Tushin went over to the general, putting three fingers to his visor in a timid and awkward movement, not as military men salute, but as priests bless. Though Tushin’s guns were meant to be shooting into the hollow, he was sending fireballs at the village of Sch246;ngraben visible straight ahead, before which large masses of French were moving forward.::2016-04-22
Woodland::4092.3275756750145::“I think,” the prince said, smiling, “that if they sent you instead of our dear Wintzingerode, you would take the Prussian king’s consent by storm.7 You’re so eloquent! Will you give me tea?”::1831-12-19
Royal Oak::485452.03978489904::Among the letters from his family there was also a letter of recommendation to Prince Bagration, which the old countess had obtained through acquaintances, on the advice of Anna Mikhailovna, and sent on to her son, asking him to take it to its destination and make use of it.::1807-01-21
Hatfield::604842.1096237637::Of spoons there was only one, sugar was more plentiful than anything else, but they could not all stir at the same time, and so it was decided that she would stir the sugar for each of them in turn. Rostov, receiving his glass, poured some rum into it and asked Marya Genrikhovna to stir it.::1847-01-09
Tustin::364716.78653380077::“And where’s the fur coat?” said Dolokhov. “Hey, Ignashka! Go to Matryona Matveevna, ask for her sable coat. I’ve heard how people elope,” Dolokhov said, winking. “She’ll come running out more dead than alive, in whatever she had on at home; if there’s any dawdling—there’ll be tears, and papa and mama, and she’ll get cold and go back. You must wrap her in a fur coat at once and carry her to the sleigh.”::1873-02-25
Porterville::23666.281623110906::The conversation did not flag all evening, turning mostly around political news. At the end of the evening it became especially lively when things got around to the rewards bestowed by the sovereign.::1973-10-22

Huntington Park::648377.0409091113::M’sieur Pierre did not know whom to answer, looked around at them all, and smiled. His smile was not like that of other people, blending into a non-smile. With him, on the contrary, when a smile came, his serious and even somewhat sullen face vanished suddenly, instantly, and another appeared—childish, kind, even slightly stupid, and as if apologetic.::1842-03-07
Greenleaf::42338.36814535419::There exists in men a certain after-dinner state of mind which, more strongly than any reasonable causes, makes a man feel content with himself and consider everyone his friend. Napoleon was in that state of mind. It seemed to him that he was surrounded by people who adored him. He was convinced that after his dinner Balashov, too, was his friend and adorer. Napoleon addressed him with a pleasant and slightly mocking smile.::1873-09-12
Mackville::554444.6487562741::“By God, miss, it’s not too long at all,” said Mavrusha, who was crawling on the floor following her young lady.::1890-11-08
Orland Park::880694.7851120174::“There are pickets on the hill, Your Excellency, in the same place as this evening,” Rostov reported, bending forward, holding his hand to his visor, and unable to repress a cheerful smile, called up in him by his ride and above all by the whine of the bullets.::1821-04-14
Ankeny::513176.7912087684::“March off to the devil, quick step, while you’re still in one piece.” And Denisov turned his horse towards the officer.::1897-12-22
Bartlett::586200.4127707646::“Ah, Sonya, if you knew him as I do! He said…He asked me what sort of promise I had made to Bolkonsky. He was glad that it rested with me to refuse him.”::2001-10-12

Green Valley::84544.094941016::“My friend,” said Princess Marya, addressing her brother from beside the crib where she was standing, “it’s better to wait…later…”::1804-04-07
Mountain::112026.41529861878::The thing was that Ilagin, with whom the Rostovs had had a quarrel and a lawsuit, used to hunt in places that customarily belonged to the Rostovs, and now as if on purpose had sent his men to the reserve where the Rostovs were hunting and had allowed his hunter to take the quarry hunted down by the Rostovs’ hounds.::1879-12-22

Dubuque::833928.4136371262::Petya was carried out and laid like a dead body in the break; Natasha and Nikolai got into the droshky.

He went with them on foot to the bridge, which they had to wade around, and ordered the hunters to ride in front with lanterns.::1966-02-16
Thornton::252029.39167622064::Petya was carried out and laid like a dead body in the break; Natasha and Nikolai got into the droshky.

Arcadia::122671.52453788332::“It’s all the same to me,” he said. “I’m just curious to know whether you’ll kill this ten or let me win it.”::1830-01-15
Mindoro::925234.5098946124::The score reached the fateful number of forty-three thousand. Rostov prepared a card which was to go corners on the three thousand just given him, when Dolokhov tapped the deck on the table, set it aside, and, taking the chalk, quickly began in his clear, strong hand, breaking the piece of chalk, to add up Rostov’s score.::1907-05-03
Canton::698128.1802488379::“Get through these hundred steps and I’m saved for sure; stand here another two minutes and I’m sure to be dead,” each man was thinking.::1838-07-05
Johnsburg::164696.86231601154::“Not all, since you won’t be there; not all,” said Prince Ippolit, laughing joyfully, and, snatching the shawl from the footman, even shoving him, he began putting it on the princess. Either from awkwardness or intentionally (no one would have been able to tell), he was a long while lowering his arms, even when the shawl was already put on, and it was as if he was embracing the young woman.::1969-03-03
Bowie::844646.5971672437::Rostov shrugged his shoulders, as if to say, “So do I, but what to do!” and, having given orders, went back to Telyanin.::1897-03-09
Johnstown Center::57208.12600917857::“What do you think?” Vera said with a subtle smile. “You’re so perceptive, Prince, and understand people’s characters so well at once. What do you think about Natalie? Can she be constant in her attachments? Can she, like other women” (Vera meant herself), “fall in love with a man once and remain faithful to him forever? That is what I consider real love. What do you think, Prince?”::1857-11-01
White Plains::580590.6384248385::“Ah, mon ami.  I only pray to God and hope He will hear me. Andr233;,” she said timidly, after a moment’s silence, “I have a big request to make of you.”::1816-04-15
Dale::717193.2010529952::Pierre listened to her attentively and gravely. Prince Andrei left the room. And after him, Princess Marya left the people of God to finish their tea and took Pierre to the drawing room.::1823-12-24
Des Plaines::72989.93158835832::“No, why do you think,” Pierre suddenly began, lowering his head and looking like a butting bull, “why do you think that way? You shouldn’t think that way.”::1976-09-25
Doral::977745.1635211371::M233;tivier, shrugging his shoulders, went over to Mlle Bourienne, who, hearing the shouting, had come running from the neighboring room.::1825-10-02
Buena Vista::347150.34817560297::The prince stopped. He noticed the impression these words made on his daughter. She hung her head and was about to cry.::1909-10-14
Danbury::942241.3547822516::Sonya went out to the corridor, so as to go to the barn. Nikolai hastily went to the front porch, saying that he was hot. Indeed, it was stuffy in the house because of the crowd of people.::1990-01-07
Margate::77727.24343607674::“I wouldn’t have believed it if someone had told me I could love so much,” said Prince Andrei. “It’s quite a different feeling from what I knew before. The whole world is divided for me into two parts: one is she, and there is all happiness, hope, light; the other is where she is not, and there everything is dejection and darkness…”::1889-09-25
Kieler::516387.22416942497::“Give me that letter,” said Kutuzov, turning to Prince Andrei. “Take a look, if you please,” and Kutuzov, with a mocking smile at the corners of his lips, read in German for the Austrian general the following passage from the letter of Archduke Ferdinand:::1820-05-21
Santee::806257.5328018743::“Yes, yes,” he said, “it’s hard, I’m afraid it’s hard to find…it happens! Yes, it happens to everybody…” And, giving his son a fleeting look, the count started out of the room…Nikolai had been prepared for a rebuff, but he had never expected this…::1919-09-16
Phlox::971076.5144625588::The hunter on the knoll stood with his whip raised; the gentlemen rode up to him at a walk; the hounds, running just on the horizon, were turning away from the hare; the rest of the hunters were also riding away. Everything moved slowly and sedately.::1902-07-20
Fox Crossing::623562.831907453::“Le g233;n233;ral Koutouzoff,”  said Bolkonsky, emphasizing the last syllable, zoff , like a Frenchman, “a bien voulu de moi pour aide-de-camp…” ‡45::1848-02-17

Grand Forks::34695.070071649956::“Lovely, lovely, uncle! More, more!” cried Natasha as soon as he finished. She jumped up from her place, embraced her uncle, and kissed him. “Nikolenka, Nikolenka!” she said, glancing at her brother, as if asking him: what on earth is it?::1952-02-13
Midwest City::863099.8956175165::“But there’s a difference between not acknowledging him as emperor and calling him General Buonaparte,” said Bolkonsky.::1964-07-25

Medford::364197.3780124117::Tushin did not tell him that there were no covering troops, though that was the plain truth. He was afraid to let down  another officer that way and silently, with fixed eyes, looked straight into Bagration’s face, as a confused student looks into his examiner’s eyes.::1855-05-21
Corvallis::767071.962715446::Having reached the troops of the left flank, he did not ride forward, where the shooting was, but went looking for the general and the officers where they could not be, and therefore did not deliver the order.::1872-05-11
Hendersonville::854815.2948558364::“Ah, you devil’s puppet, stir your stumps, get looking,” Denisov shouted suddenly, turning purple and hurling himself at the lackey with a menacing gesture. “There’ll be a purse, or I’ll flog you to death. I’ll flog you all to death!”::1935-10-13

Tinley Park::948418.6698854963::This was that initial period of a campaign when the troops still find themselves in good order, almost on the level of a peacetime review of maneuvers, only with a tinge of warlike showiness in their dress, and with a moral tinge of that gaiety and enthusiasm that always accompany the beginning of a campaign.::1940-09-13

Wanderoos::786068.3023544021::Countess Bezukhov was entitled to her reputation as an enchanting woman. She was able to say what she did not think, and especially to flatter, with perfect simplicity and naturalness.::1904-07-23
Monterey::810513.5849035613::I go to bed in a happy and calm mood. Great Lord, help me to walk in Thy ways: (1) to overcome the part of wrath by gentleness and slowness; (2) of lust by restraint and repulsion; (3) to withdraw from vanity, yet not lose the habit of (a) work in government service, (b) family cares, (c) friendly relations, and(d) economic concerns.::1979-11-03
Plainville::361721.3318650158::The princess said nothing. All that could be heard were the sounds of the efforts of the struggle over the portfolio. It was clear that if she did start to talk, it would not be flattering for Anna Mikhailovna. Anna Mikhailovna held on tight, but in spite of that her voice retained all its sweet, drawling softness.::1966-11-10
Mount Zion::925163.9239628722::“I do,” Prince Andrei said hastily. “I said that a fallen woman should be forgiven, but I did not say that I could forgive. I cannot.”::1816-07-22

Valdosta::277877.83812380506::“Slightly wounded, but promoted to officer; he’s recovered now, he wrote himself,” she said through her tears.::1871-01-13
Trego::507756.49657744623::Sonya fell to thinking. The question of how to write to Nicolas, and whether she should write to him, was a question that tormented her. Now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero, would it be right on her part to remind him of herself and, as it were, of the commitment he had taken upon himself in her regard.::2008-04-25
Brill::592837.9358616179::“You think so?…” said Anna Pavlovna, in order to say something, and again turned to her duties as mistress of the house, but Pierre committed the reverse discourtesy. Earlier he had walked away without hearing out a lady who was talking to him; now he held with his conversation a lady who needed to leave him. Lowering his head and spreading his big feet, he began to explain to Anna Pavlovna why he thought that the abb233;’s plan was a chimera.::1852-11-15
Oak Lawn::192153.27848419995::“So, Sonya, here you were saying all kinds of stupid things about him,” Natasha began in a meek voice, the sort of voice in which children speak when they want to be praised. “He and I had a talk tonight.”::1866-10-09
Novato::866188.2154679049::They went into the elegantly, newly, richly decorated dining room. Everything from the napkins to the silverware, china, and crystal bore that special stamp of newness that is found in the households of the recently married. In the middle of supper, the prince leaned his elbow on the table and, with an expression of nervous irritation such as Pierre had never seen in his friend before, began to talk, like a man who has long had something on his heart and suddenly decides to speak it out:::1952-03-10
Carlsville::371241.57585271745::“No, gentlemen, no…don’t think…I understand very well, you’re wrong to think it of me…I…for me…for the honor of the regiment…well, so? I’ll show it by my deeds, and for me the honor of the flag…Well, anyhow, it’s true, I’m to blame!…” Tears welled up in his eyes. “I’m to blame, I’m to blame all around! Well, what more do you want?…”::1906-10-01
Browns Lake::164352.60848810163::But Rostov tore his arm free and, with as much spite as if Denisov was his greatest enemy, directly and firmly fixed his eyes on him.::1854-06-14
Chicopee::493400.4422622856::A tall, beautiful lady entered the neighboring box, with an enormous braid and very bared, white, full shoulders and neck, on which hung a double string of big pearls. She took a long time to settle herself, rustling her heavy silk gown.::1947-09-03
Dearborn Heights::407587.26238495455::The infantry regiments, caught unawares in the woods, ran out of the woods, and, companies mixing with other companies, retreated in disordered crowds. One soldier uttered in fear the words: “Cut off!”—senseless and terrible in time of war—and the words, together with the fear, communicated themselves to the whole mass.::1963-05-17
Utica::585986.3465465928::At the Rostovs’ it was the name day of the Natalyas, mother and younger daughter.24 Since morning, coach and sixes had constantly been driving up and leaving, bringing people with congratulations to the big house of the countess Rostov on Povarskaya Street, which was known to all Moscow. The countess with her beautiful older daughter and the guests, who constantly replaced each other, were sitting in the drawing room.::1936-03-23
Berwyn::257009.89669688512::The next day the emperor’s gentleman-in-waiting, M. de Turenne, came to Balashov and conveyed to him the emperor Napoleon’s wish to honor him with an audience.::1892-04-17
Bradenton::872655.2765091868::Pierre felt that he was the center of everything, and this position delighted and embarrassed him. He found himself in the state of a man immersed in some occupation. He neither saw, nor understood, nor heard anything clearly. Only rarely, unexpectedly, did fragmentary thoughts and impressions of reality flash in his soul.::1879-09-25
Poy Sippi::834451.144241666::“Very nice! What a horse he’ll be!” he said to himself and, smiling and holding his saber, ran up the steps, his spurs jingling. The German landlord, in a vest and a cap, holding the fork he was using to clear away dung, peeked out of the cowshed. As soon as he saw Rostov, the German’s face suddenly brightened. He smiled merrily and winked: “Sch246;n, gut Morgen! Sch246;n, gut Morgen!” *182 he repeated, obviously taking pleasure in greeting the young man.::1893-01-16
Hempstead::844868.4055413733::The reason for the confusion was that, while the Austrian cavalry was moving on the left flank, the superior officers decided that our center was too far from the right flank, and the entire cavalry was ordered to cross over to the right. Several thousand cavalry were advancing ahead of the infantry, and the infantry was forced to wait.::1861-11-04
Arkdale::446261.38787767256::Having sat at the table for a while, Speransky corked the wine bottle and saying: “Good wine costs a pretty penny these days,” handed it to the servant and got up. They all got up and with the same noisy talk went to the drawing room. Speransky was handed two envelopes brought by a courier. He took them and went to his study. As soon as he left, the general merriment died down, and the guests began talking sensibly and quietly with each other.::1820-11-07
Hanford::477017.90733415796::Marya Genrikhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a young, pretty German woman, whom the doctor had married in Poland. Either because he lacked means, or because he did not want to part with a young wife so early in their marriage, the doctor took her along everywhere with the hussar regiment, and his jealousy had become a habitual subject of jokes among the hussar officers.::2017-09-22
Rocky Mount::879760.7509966411::“I don’t believe I’ve said anything to you, Masha, about reproaching my wife for anything or being displeased with her. Why are you saying all this to me?”::1863-08-14
Port Arthur::851799.8370805983::Sonya had not seen anything, she had been just about to blink her eyes and get up when she heard Natasha’s voice say “She’s sure to…” She did not want to disappoint either Dunyasha or Natasha, and it was hard to go on sitting there. She did not know how and why that cry had escaped her when she covered her eyes with her hand.::1878-10-17
Shoreline::236848.57452851438::On the eve of his departure from Petersburg, Prince Andrei brought along Pierre, who had not once been to the Rostovs’ since the time of the ball. Pierre looked perplexed and embarrassed. He was talking with the mother. Natasha sat down with Sonya by the chess table, thereby inviting Prince Andrei to join her. He went over to them.::1983-01-19
Edmund::902532.2263191413::“Tell the prince that labor has begun,” said Marya Bogdanovna, glancing significantly at the messenger. Tikhon went and told him.::1829-06-19
Mount Tabor::385998.74084951356::“Mama! what’s for dessert?” cried Natasha, boldly now and with capricious merriment, certain beforehand that her escapade would be taken well.::1942-12-04
Deerbrook::816624.9802297029::“Et savez-vous que vous 234;tes terrible avec votre petit air innocent,”  the viscount continued. “Je plains le pauvre mari, ce petit officier, qui se donne des airs de prince r233;gnant.” †69::1851-07-05

Lakewood::279760.2098008046::“All right, then!” shouted the little officer, not intimidated and not going away. “This is highway robbery, so I’ll…”::1822-04-09
Manhattan::331131.3035194646::“Mon p232;re—Andr233;?”  said the graceless, awkward princess, with such an inexpressible loveliness of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father could not endure her gaze and, sobbing, turned away.::1824-02-11
Highland::881200.5283915793::“Andr233;, si vous avez la foi, vous vous seriez adress233; 224; Dieu, pour qu’il vous donne l’amour que vous ne sentez pas, et votre pri232;re aurait 233;t233; exauc233;e.” *173::1846-03-17
Taycheedah::581672.7036404475::“Of course, good sir, I was deemed worthy. There was radiance on her face, like a heavenly light, and it dripped from the holy Mother’s cheek, just dripped and dripped…”::1923-05-14
Paramount::289025.0651551416::“One moment, one moment, don’t come in, papa!” she cried to her father, who had opened the door, still under the gauze of her skirt, which covered her whole face. Sonya slammed the door. A moment later the count was admitted. He was wearing a dark blue tailcoat, stockings and shoes, was perfumed and pomaded.::1979-07-14
Commerce City::427125.57904507976::“How shall I tell you,” Natasha replied. “I was in love with Boris, with my teacher, with Denisov, but this is not the same at all. I feel peaceful, firm. I know that there’s no one better than he, and I feel so calm, so good now. Not at all like before…”::1891-07-13
Huntersville::554892.6331922574::The squadron in which Rostov served had just had time to mount its horses when it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as on the Enns bridge, there was no one between the squadron and the enemy, and there lay between them, separating them, that same terrible line of the unknown and of fear, like the line separating the living from the dead. All the men sensed that line, and the question of whether they would or would not cross that line, and how they would cross it, troubled them.::1958-06-14
Euless::6044.102964047449::Pierre was sitting in the drawing room, where Shinshin, knowing he had come from abroad, had started a boring political conversation with him, in which other people joined.

Langes Corners::485460.5835158531::“You say that withdrawal beyond the Niemen is demanded of me in order to begin negotiations; but in just the same way it was demanded of me two months ago that I withdraw beyond the Oder and the Vistula, and, despite that, you agree to conduct negotiations.”::1877-11-11
Pocatello::86480.98527374303::“And still the only thing I love and cherish is triumph over all of them, I cherish that mysterious power and glory hovering over me here in this mist!”::1981-03-10
Carson City::760443.787957578::“So they were in a hurry to get started, but once they got started—here we stand witless in the middle of a field—it’s all these cursed Germans confusing things. What muddleheaded devils!”::1808-08-23
Lake Koshkonong::510975.91862823366::The talk was about Speransky, the news of whose sudden exile and alleged treason had just reached Moscow.17::1880-11-13

Valton::538561.8549911028::“Not all, since you won’t be there; not all,” said Prince Ippolit, laughing joyfully, and, snatching the shawl from the footman, even shoving him, he began putting it on the princess. Either from awkwardness or intentionally (no one would have been able to tell), he was a long while lowering his arms, even when the shawl was already put on, and it was as if he was embracing the young woman.::1960-09-17
Colton::723084.27638286::These nightly visits of Natasha, which took place before the count’s return from the club, were one of the favorite pleasures of both mother and daughter.::1912-01-15
Van Buskirk::293813.0502209334::Having given more and more orders of various kinds, he was on his way to rest with his little countess, but remembered another necessary thing, came back himself, brought the chef and the manager back, and again began giving orders.

Newry::641452.4248066541::Napoleon met Balashov with a cheerful and benign air. Not only was there no expression in him of embarrassment or self-reproach for his morning’s outburst, but, on the contrary, he tried to encourage Balashov. Clearly it was Napoleon’s long-standing conviction that the possibility of mistakes did not exist for him, and to his mind everything he did was good, not because it agreed with any notion of what was good and bad, but because he  did it.::1911-03-17
Casa Grande::674585.7295586461::All through the argument and the rest of dinner, the little princess was silent and kept glancing fearfully now at Princess Marya, now at her father-in-law. When they left the table, she took her sister-in-law by the arm and led her to another room.::1935-07-05
West Haven::929345.6484904934::“No, Pyotr Nikolaevich, I merely wish to prove, sir, that the cavalry is much less profitable than the infantry. Now look, Pyotr Nikolaevich, just consider my position.”::1855-05-07
Rosemead::160439.2615746584::“Marya Lvovna Karagin with daughter!” the countess’s enormous footman announced in a bass voice, coming to the door of the drawing room. The countess pondered and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husband’s portrait on it.::1875-08-20
Glen Haven::989008.2367588662::“Then allow me to convey your regrets, and I’m certain that our adversaries will agree to accept your apology,” said Nesvitsky (like the other participants in the affair, and like everyone in similar affairs, not believing that things would go so far as an actual duel). “You know, Count, it’s much more noble to acknowledge your mistake than to bring the matter to a point beyond repair…There was no offense on either side. Allow me to talk it over…”::1809-09-16
Blue Springs::562732.7930215037::This view of things, widely spread in the higher spheres of the army, found support both in Petersburg and in the chancellor Rumyantsev, who, for other reasons of state, was also for peace.::2007-02-19
Tainter Lake::933119.8787775341::Prince Nikolai Andreevich sat in his usual place at the end of the sofa, moved a chair for Prince Vassily towards him, pointed to it, and began asking questions about political matters and the latest news.

Hoboken::354164.9372754625::And if being in the room like that seemed improper and burdensome to Danilo, having any sort of dealings with a young lady seemed simply impossible to him.

Normal::903096.3501578192::Kutuzov turned away. The same smile of the eyes flashed over his face as when he had turned away from Captain Timokhin. He turned away and winced, as if wishing to express thereby that all that Dolokhov had said to him and all that he could say had long, long been known to him, that it all bored him, and that it was all by no means what was needed. He turned away and made for the coach.::1898-05-04
Lampson::54576.48664967263::“I wrote a decision on your memorandum and it was passed on to the committee. I do not  approve,” said Arakcheev, getting up and taking a paper from his desk. “Here,” he handed it to Prince Andrei.::1841-10-14
Wabeno::117665.94139298325::Pierre took hold of the crosspieces, pulled, and, with a crash, here broke and there ripped out the oak frame.::1818-08-19
Bonita Springs::853908.9186322535::Pierre listened to her attentively and gravely. Prince Andrei left the room. And after him, Princess Marya left the people of God to finish their tea and took Pierre to the drawing room.::1817-11-02
Mount Prospect::394402.7699262931::“How good! Excellent, really,” said Nikolai with a sort of involuntary disdain, as if he was ashamed to confess that he found the sounds very pleasing.::2006-04-04
Cathedral City::676422.2898260695::“Yes, indeed, there’s a true wise man!” thought Pierre. “He doesn’t see anything beyond the present moment of pleasure, nothing troubles him—and therefore he’s always cheerful, content, and calm.

Briggsville::206163.84458060065::“Your Excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to stay in Prince Bagration’s detachment.”::1899-11-15

Sobieski::153914.07412299086::“Do you want him to answer everybody at once?” asked Prince Andrei. “Besides, in the acts of a statesman one must distinguish among the acts of the private person, the military leader, and the emperor. So it seems to me.”::1871-07-13
Connorsville::133345.13469816945::With that the anecdote ended. Though it was not clear why he had told it, and why it absolutely had to be told in Russian, all the same Anna Pavlovna and the others appreciated Prince Ippolit’s social grace, in thus pleasantly putting an end to M’sieur Pierre’s unpleasant and ungracious outburst. After the anecdote, the conversation broke up into small, insignificant commentaries on past and future balls, on performances, and on who would see whom when and where.::1975-09-05
Pensacola::260529.5077996146::Some of the nearest relations were still there. They were sitting in the big drawing room. Prince Vassily walked lazily over to Pierre. Pierre stood up and said it was already late. Prince Vassily gave him a sternly questioning look, as if what he had said was so strange that he could not even hear it well. But then the expression of sternness changed, and Prince Vassily pulled Pierre’s arm down, seated him, and smiled gently.::1921-12-07
Lake Shangrila::748710.8139173229::With his naked eye, Prince Andrei saw below, to the right, a dense column of French coming up to meet the Apsherontsy, no further than five hundred paces from where Kutuzov was standing.::1811-11-16
Lake Wazeecha::905787.286897773::“Anatole would come to borrow money from her and would kiss her bare shoulders. She didn’t give him the money, but allowed him to kiss her. Her father, joking, tried to arouse her jealousy; she said with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: he can do as he likes, she said of me. I asked her once whether she felt any signs of pregnancy. She laughed scornfully and said she was not such a fool as to want to have children, and that she would not have children from me. ”::1961-12-20
Palm Beach Gardens::773658.2699515636::Having come on Tuesday evening to H233;l232;ne’s magnificent salon, Boris was not given a clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to come.

Brackett::267333.73367729894::After these words, the Mason, as if tired after talking for so long, again leaned back on the sofa and closed his eyes.

Lake Havasu City::505544.2817296695::“All the same, seriously speaking,” replied Prince Andrei, “we can still say without boasting that this is a bit better than Ulm…”::1993-11-14
Sayner::942926.3783847974::But these words sounded like a pitiful, desperate cry and a plea for forgiveness. As soon as Rostov heard the sound of that voice, a huge burden of doubt fell from his soul. He felt joy and in the same instant also pity for the wretched man standing before him; but he had to bring the matter he had begun to a conclusion.::1871-04-23
Dunbar::542804.247552756::“Ah! aujourd’hui on m’a racont233; une anecdote moscovite, charmante: il faut que je vous en r233;gale. Vous m’excusez, vicomte, il faut que je raconte en russe. Autrement on ne sentira pas le sel de l’histoire.” †62::1865-04-24

Albany::492446.66458627174::Pierre sniffed silently, looking at her. Up to then he had reproached her in his soul and had tried to despise her; but now he felt such pity for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach.::1818-08-21

Harrisonburg::825707.1094021086::Rostov went to the front hall again and noticed that there were already many officers and generals in full-dress uniform past whom he would have to walk.::1935-05-20
West Sacramento::919182.3186282341::Weyrother again smiled that same ironic smile, which said that to him  it was ridiculous and strange to meet objections from Russian generals and prove that of which he was not only all too well assured himself, but of which he had assured the two emperors.::1874-04-15
Blueberry::898386.5684226371::“Never mind, Princess, don’t worry,” said Marya Bogdanovna, “everything will be fine without the doctor.”::1977-03-17
Lenexa::993035.3836671789::“Well, thank God, Princess,” Marya Bogdanovna said, without quickening her pace. “You young girls oughtn’t to know about these things.”::2017-10-05
Maplewood::135104.78597590126::Accustomed though Balashov was to court solemnity, the luxury and magnificence of the emperor Napoleon’s court struck him.::2000-05-02
Irma::613545.2157982942::“How clear it is, Nicolas!” Sonya’s voice said. Nikolai turned to look at Sonya and bent down to see her face more closely. A totally new, dear face with black eyebrows and mustache, both near and distant in the moonlight, peeked from the sable fur.::1842-09-22
Kingsport::34911.32256744645::The day after his visit to Count Arakcheev, Prince Andrei went to a soir233;e at Count Kochubey’s.

City of Milford (balance)::362695.9676523459::Having gone past the guards and an empty space, Rostov, to avoid getting into the front line again, as he had during the attack of the horse guards, followed the line of the reserves, making a wide circle around the place where the hottest shooting and cannon fire were heard. Suddenly, ahead of him and behind our troops, in a place where he could never have supposed the enemy to be, he heard nearby musket fire.::1975-01-08
Emerald::224757.08759311851::“However, if you order it, Your Majesty,” said Kutuzov, raising his head and again changing his tone to that of a dull, unthinking, but obedient general.::1820-07-15
Little Rapids::691627.4900085345::The concentrated movement which began that morning in the emperors’ headquarters and gave a push to all subsequent movement was like the first movement of the central wheel in a big tower clock. Slowly one wheel started, another turned, a third, and the wheels, pulleys, and gears were set turning more and more quickly, chimes began to ring, figures popped out, and the clock hands started their measured advance, showing the result of that movement.::1874-01-23

Peabody::766989.3965036778::At the men’s end of the table, the conversation was becoming more and more animated.

Minnetonka::814588.6465347717::When Natasha’s turn came again, she got up and, stepping quickly in her beribboned little shoes, she timidly ran alone across the room to the corner where Denisov was sitting.

Joplin::481652.1268805333::Pierre was sincere in answering affirmatively Anna Pavlovna’s question about the artfulness of H233;l232;ne’s behavior. If he ever thought about H233;l232;ne, he thought precisely about her beauty and that extraordinary, calm ability of hers to be silently dignified in society.::1804-01-07
Rome::707372.4026831188::Natasha looked at Sonya with astonished eyes. Clearly, this question had presented itself to her for the first time, and she did not know how to answer it.::1954-08-02

La Crosse::769581.3620544776::“That’s my Mitka the coachman…I bought him a good balalaika, I like it,” said the uncle. It was the uncle’s custom that, when he came back from the hunt, Mitka would play the balalaika in the bachelor hunters’ room. The uncle liked listening to this music.::1974-09-11
Cavour::124537.86000495226::“If you had told me long ago, mama, I would have left at once,” she said and went to her room. But, passing through the sitting room, she noticed two couples sitting symmetrically by the two windows. She stopped and smiled disdainfully. Sonya was sitting close to Nikolai, who was writing out some verses for her, the first he had ever written. Boris and Natasha were sitting by the other window and fell silent when Vera came in.

Grapevine::509349.52828946477::“The famous Duport, the ballet master—you haven’t seen him? Then you won’t understand. Here’s what I am.” Natasha rounded her arms, took up her skirt as if to dance, ran a few steps, turned, made an entrechat, tapped her foot against her ankle, and went a few steps on the very tips of her toes. “See me standing?

Apple Valley::689563.2105532276::After Nikolai’s departure, the Rostovs’ house became sadder than ever. The countess was so emotionally upset that she fell ill.::1800-03-21
Tigard::487308.68046629295::Rostov rode at a walk, not knowing why and to whom he was going now. The sovereign was wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible not to believe it now. Rostov rode in the direction indicated to him and in which he could see a tower and a church in the distance. Why should he hurry?

Oak Park::986872.8995863571::“No, what is there to talk about!” said Pierre. “It makes no difference…So, are we ready?” he added. “Only tell me, where am I to go and where am I to shoot?” he said with an unnaturally meek smile.

Hoffman Estates::270077.002101909::The blue, clear eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as at the regimental commander, as if tearing by their expression the curtain of convention that had so widely separated the commander in chief from the soldier.::1819-08-17

Grand Island::378370.58312026516::Never had the amorous air in the Rostovs’ house, the atmosphere of being in love, manifested itself so strongly as during these festive days. “Seize the moments of happiness, make them love you, fall in love yourself! That is the only real thing in this world—the rest is all nonsense. And that is the one thing we’re taken up with here,” said this atmosphere.::1905-02-05

Olympia::875321.9824850179::“What is it?” the countess asked fearfully, but, seeing from her daughter’s face that it was a prank, she sternly waved her hand at her, making a threatening and negative gesture with her head.::1992-11-06
Long Lake::171128.38254050212::“Look at ’em, it’s like a dam burst,” the Cossack said, stopping hopelessly. “Are there many of you there?”::1979-01-09
Willard::526600.6898349086::The doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and joked with her, paying no attention to her grief-stricken face. On the other hand, when he went out to the other room, the countess hurriedly followed him, and he, assuming a serious air and shaking his head pensively, said that, although there was danger, he had hopes for the effectiveness of this latest medicine, and that they must wait and see; that the illness was more moral, but…::1858-07-18

Galveston::41521.34145783881::Ilya Andreich approved of this suggestion, grasping its good sense at once. If the old man softens, it will be all the better if they come to him in Moscow or Bald Hills afterwards; if not, then they could marry against his will only in Otradnoe.::1932-09-15

Edgewood::808096.836726793::“God has nothing to do with it. Well, tell me,” he went on, getting back on his hobbyhorse, “how have the Germans taught you to fight Bonaparte by this new science of yours known as strategy?”::1863-12-24

Eagleton::701767.0540055808::“No, gentlemen, no…don’t think…I understand very well, you’re wrong to think it of me…I…for me…for the honor of the regiment…well, so? I’ll show it by my deeds, and for me the honor of the flag…Well, anyhow, it’s true, I’m to blame!…” Tears welled up in his eyes. “I’m to blame, I’m to blame all around! Well, what more do you want?…”::1890-11-16
Beaumont::412022.81496181234::“Listen to me, I’m saying it to you for the last time. Why would I joke with you? Did I thwart you? Who arranged everything, who found the priest, who ordered the passport, who got the money? All me.”::1864-10-20

Leland::685590.0216502019::“Ah, Your Excellency,” Zherkov mixed in, not taking his eyes from the hussars, but still with his na239;ve manner, which made it impossible to tell whether he was speaking seriously or not. “Ah, Your Excellency! What a way to reason! Send two men, and who’s going to give us a Vladimir with a bow?5 This way they may get beaten, but the squadron will be distinguished, and he’ll get a bow. Our Bogdanych knows the system.”::1974-08-10
Bozeman::544734.8552017682::Across the paper was scrawled, in pencil, without capitals, without orthography, without punctuation: “unsoundly compiled since copied from french military regulations and unnecessarily deviating from military articles.”::1859-04-10

Burleson::442578.184970515::“Prince Auersperg is standing on this side, our side, and defending us; I suppose he’s defending us very poorly, but still he’s defending us. But Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has not yet been taken and, I hope, will not be taken, because it’s mined and there’s an order to blow it up. Otherwise we’d have been in the mountains of Bohemia long ago, and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires.”::1899-05-12
Riplinger::814337.4057173477::“In Moscou  there is a ladee, une dame.  And she is very stingee. She must ’ave two valets de pied ‡63 behind the carriage. And of very grand height. That was in her taste. Now, she ‘ad une femme de chambre, §64 also of grand height. She said…”::1933-09-16
Coachella::678570.9495223499::“My friend, what have you done in Moscow? Why did you quarrel with Lelya, mon cher?

Sayreville::472063.3510771494::The magnificent reception room was filled. Everyone rose deferentially when the commander in chief, having spent about half an hour alone with the sick man, came out, responding slightly to the bows and trying to go quickly past the looks that doctors, clergymen, and relations directed at him. Prince Vassily, grown thin and pale during those days, accompanied the commander in chief and quietly repeated something to him several times.::1940-07-14
Ocoee::325993.61354948254::Andrei said nothing: he was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him. The old man got up and handed the letter to his son.::1913-01-05
Hackensack::705660.0459954311::They fell silent. Prince Andrei looked closely into those mirror-like eyes which did not let anything in, and felt how ridiculous it was that he could have expected anything from Speransky and from all his activity connected with him, and that he could have ascribed importance to what Speransky was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter went on ringing in Prince Andrei’s ears long after he had left Speransky.::2014-03-01
Cutler Bay::254804.79237107057::“Listen, if you please, little countess,” she said to Natasha with a smile very much like the uncle’s smile. “He plays nicely,” she said.::2016-01-21
Iron Belt::477620.36688439734::He guessed his movements ahead of time, and felt merrier and merrier. He noticed a solitary tree ahead. This tree was first ahead of him, in the middle of the line that seemed so terrible. But then they crossed that line, and not only was there nothing frightening, but everything became merrier and livelier. “Oh, how I’m going to slash at him,” thought Rostov, gripping the hilt of his saber.::1878-08-08

Strongsville::216794.52403636934::“Life won’t leave one alone as it is. I’d be glad to do nothing, but then, on the one hand, the local nobility deemed me worthy of being elected their marshal;16 I barely got out of it. They couldn’t understand that I don’t have what it takes, don’t have the sort of good-natured and bustling banality needed for it. Then there’s this house, which had to be built so as to have a corner where I could be at peace. Now it’s the militia.”::1841-06-16
Altoona::222244.24513046758::“Where are you going?” he said suddenly, turning to Prince Andrei, who got up and made for his room.::1918-10-17
Bothell::688751.0640802365::“Nonsense, sit down, drink,” said Anatole, and he poured him a big glass of Madeira. The coachman’s eyes lit up at the sight of the wine. He declined out of propriety, then drank and wiped his mouth with a red silk handkerchief tucked inside his hat.::1921-03-01
Attleboro::268375.1472789528::“Well, now for a declamation!” said Speransky, coming out of his study. “An astonishing talent!” he said to Prince Andrei. Magnitsky at once assumed a pose and began to recite humorous verses he had composed in French about certain persons well-known in Petersburg, and was interrupted several times by applause. When the verses were over, Prince Andrei went up to Speransky to take his leave.::1979-02-24
Haltom City::685719.2546269419::“And here she is, the queen of Petersburg, Countess Bezukhov,” she said, pointing to the entering H233;l232;ne.::2010-08-17

North Miami Beach::665369.0122301254::The beautiful Vera, who had such an irritating, unpleasant effect on everyone, smiled and, apparently untouched by what had been said to her, went up to the mirror and straightened her scarf and hair. Looking at her beautiful face, she appeared to become even colder and calmer.::1851-06-22
Tichigan::546432.3817478605::The prince lapsed into indifferent silence. Anna Pavlovna, with her courtly and feminine adroitness and ready tact, wanted both to swat the prince for daring to make such a pronouncement about a person recommended to the empress, and at the same time to comfort him.::1899-01-23
York::175106.73091332807::“He was heard at the council of war and will be heard when he talks to the point; but to drag our feet and wait for something now, when Bonaparte is afraid of a general battle more than anything—is impossible.”::1822-06-21

Lombard::466150.89279362664::Returning from his southern journey in the happiest state of mind, Pierre carried out a long-standing intention of his—to go and visit his friend Bolkonsky, whom he had not seen for two years.::1969-07-18
Drummond::586214.9416515443::“Nothing, it’s all the same; I have only come to have a talk with you, Catiche, about business,” said the prince, sitting with an air of fatigue in the armchair from which she had gotten up. “How warm you keep it, though,” he said. “Well, sit down here, causons. ”*119::1835-05-19

Marana::681471.3021210582::“Is this your saber?” he shouted. The girls jumped away. Denisov, with frightened eyes, hid his shaggy legs under the blanket, glancing at his friend for help. The door admitted Petya and closed again. Behind the door there was laughter.::1949-02-09
Lake Wisconsin::871538.8287269248::“Hallooloo,” Rostov said in a whisper, protruding his lips. The dogs, jingling the metal rings of their collars, jumped up, cocking their ears.

DeKalb::150421.0796413752::“Yes, perhaps…” Dolokhov answered coldly and angrily, glancing at Sonya, and, frowning, he glanced at Nikolai exactly as he had looked at Pierre during the club dinner.::1924-09-18
Liberty Pole::362685.2282379909::“And how can you judge what would have been better!” he shouted, his face suddenly suffused with blood. “How can you judge the sovereign’s actions, what right have we to discuss it?! We can understand neither the goals nor the actions of the sovereign!”::1809-06-04
Prescott Valley::466971.28571193357::Anatole agreed and went to Moscow, where he stayed with Pierre. At first, Pierre received Anatole reluctantly, but then he got used to him, occasionally went carousing with him, and gave him money in the guise of loans.::1937-09-01
Salem::695657.6404669327::By the back gate where he had stopped, Dolokhov was struggling with the yard porter, who had tried to lock the gate after Anatole went in.

Benderville::86490.77508488412::He felt that it would take only one word from this man for that whole mass (and he himself bound up with it—an insignificant speck) to go through fire and water, to crime, to death, or to the greatest heroism, and therefore he could not but tremble and thrill at the sight of that approaching word.::1976-07-09
Waubeka::358637.2165370656::“No, I must. Maybe it’s suffisance *288 on my part, but it’s still better to say everything. If you refused for my sake, I must tell you the whole truth. I love you, I think, more than anyone…”::1887-09-20

Concord::87416.85931000109::“The emperor Alexander,” she said, with the sadness that always accompanied her talk about the imperial family, “declared that he would leave it to the French themselves to choose their form of government. And I think there’s no doubt that the whole nation, freed of the usurper, will throw itself into the arms of the lawful king,” Anna Pavlovna said, trying to be amiable to the 233;migr233; and royalist.::2011-02-21
Pittsfield::77711.06400563865::Prince Andrei replied. After that question, other equally simple questions followed: “Was Kutuzov in good health? How long ago had he left Krems?” and so on.

Daleyville::587984.5726426059::“So I’m just like all the rest, when it’s not a matter of the chase. Well, but when it is, watch out!” was, as it seemed to Nikolai, what the dog’s look said.::1950-06-16

Brea::860353.6080353218::Bagration, knowing Bolkonsky to be a favorite and trusted adjutant, received him with a superior officer’s special distinction and indulgence, explained to him that there would probably be a battle that day or the next, and allowed him full freedom to stay by him during the battle or to supervise the order of retreat in the rear guard, “which was also very important.”::1965-02-17
Linden::592167.9661203282::“Mais charmante!” *374 he said, evidently about Natasha, as she did not so much hear as understand from the movement of his lips. Then he walked to the front row and sat down next to Dolokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and casual way that same Dolokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He smiled at him with a merry wink and rested his foot against the rail.::1974-11-13

Everyone in the reception room rushed forward and down the stairs.::1975-03-22
Kearny::397339.1778389899::The regimental commander was afraid that he might be blamed for that and made no reply. Just then the officer noticed the face of the captain with the red nose and drawn-in stomach and mimicked his face and pose so perfectly that Nesvitsky could not keep from laughing. Kutuzov turned around. It was clear that the officer could control his face at will: the moment Kutuzov turned around, the officer managed to make a scowl and then assume a most serious, deferential, and innocent expression.::1935-09-01
Midland::36580.91317262435::At that same time, Andrei was sitting with Pierre and telling him of his love for Natasha and of his firm intention to marry her.::1841-11-23
Leyden::545083.0084103841::“I am not joking with you, kindly keep silent!” shouted Bolkonsky, and, taking Nesvitsky by the arm, he walked away from Zherkov, who was at a loss how to reply.::1855-03-03
Goose Creek::16429.908870189025::“Look at ’em, it’s like a dam burst,” the Cossack said, stopping hopelessly. “Are there many of you there?”::1893-02-14
Urbana::978413.5378428727::“We’re philosophizing,” said Natasha, glancing at him for a moment, and continuing the conversation. The conversation had gone on to dreams.::1826-03-04
State College::255465.08153352432::“What has happened?” he asked himself. “I killed a lover,  yes, I killed my wife’s lover. Yes, it happened. Why? How did I come to that?” “Because you married her,” an inner voice answered.::1909-09-03
Winter Garden::979719.8258092212::“So this is how she is, and I’m a fool!” he thought, looking at her shining eyes and happy, rapturous smile, such as he had never seen before, which made dimples on her cheeks under the mustache.::1895-03-18
Belleville::399029.86424354836::“I tell you for the last time: turn all your attention to yourself, lay chains upon your feelings, and seek blessedness not in passions, but in your own heart…The source of blessedness is not outside, but inside us…”::1859-05-14
Danville::227159.74185760634::And with the air of a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make use of her time, Anna Mikhailovna sent for her son and went out with him to the front hall.::1812-03-10
Edmonds::97174.40634457652::Nikolai sent his groom to call his sister and Petya to him and rode at a walk to the place where the kennelmen were gathering the hounds. Several hunters galloped to the scene of the fight.::2008-09-04

Mankato::210718.42701747257::In the adjoining room, sabers, bags, pouches, open suitcases, dirty boots lay about. Two pairs of polished boots with spurs had just been put near the wall.

Leominster::586947.3231987634::“But one must be indulgent towards little weaknesses—who doesn’t have them, Andr233;! Don’t forget that she grew up and was formed in society. And then, her position now isn’t very rosy. One must enter into each person’s position. Tout comprendre, c’est tout pardonner. *171 Just think how it is for the poor dear, in her condition, after the life she’s used to, to part with her husband and remain alone in the country? It’s very hard.”::1930-06-19
Farmington::315078.42609690217::On all sides there were loving eyes, glistening with tears of joy, there were lips that wanted to kiss him.::1915-05-19
Sherman::810489.6604405275::“Well, Sonya,” she said, and went out to the very middle of the reception room, where, in her opinion, the resonance was best. Raising her head, lowering her lifelessly hanging arms as dancers do, Natasha made a few energetic steps from heel to toe in the middle of the room and stopped.::1839-04-07
Westfield::76635.57704983148::Anna Mikhailovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess was also weeping. They wept because they were friends; and because they were kind; and because they, who had been friends since childhood, were concerned with such a mean subject—money; and because their youth was gone…But for both of them they were pleasant tears…::1981-02-11
Boulder Junction::135495.56503760628::In an abandoned tavern, before which stood the doctor’s little kibitka, there were already some five officers. Marya Genrikhovna, a plump, flaxen-haired German, in a bed-jacket and nightcap, sat in the front corner on a wide bench. Her husband, the doctor, was asleep behind her. Rostov and Ilyin, greeted with merry exclamations and guffaws, came into the room.::1979-12-06

Findlay::868346.7346745981::A strange feeling of spite and along with that of respect for the calmness of this figure came together at that moment in Rostov’s soul.::1917-03-12
Chief Lake::672013.2332171485::“Well, what are they getting at me for?…” Tushin thought to himself, looking fearfully at his superior.::1880-09-01
Woonsocket::130254.3829852022::They all dispersed. The uncle helped Natasha down from the horse and led her by the arm up the shaky plank steps of the porch. The house, unplastered, with timber walls, was not very clean inside—one could see that the aim of those living in it did not consist in keeping it spotless—but there were also no signs of neglect. The entryway smelled of fresh apples and was hung with wolf and fox pelts.::1858-09-25
Cedar Falls::251393.15650764282::On all sides one could hear the footsteps and talk of the infantry walking, driving, and settling themselves around.

Jim Falls::928497.8232201484::The croups of the horses in the front row moved. Little Rook pulled at the reins and started off himself.::1896-04-16
Beverly::747133.452265148::The princess lay in the armchair, and Mlle Bourienne rubbed her temples. Princess Marya, supporting her sister-in-law, went on looking with her beautiful, tear-filled eyes at the door through which Prince Andrei had gone and making signs of the cross at him. From the study, like gunshots, came the oft-repeated angry sounds of the old man blowing his nose. As soon as Prince Andrei left, the door to the study quickly opened, and the old man’s stern figure appeared in its white smock.::1864-10-10
King::893233.21709228::They had not yet ridden a mile when the Rostov hunt was met by another five riders with dogs emerging from the mist. At their head rode a fresh, handsome old man with big gray mustaches.::1857-04-04
Coppell::980421.5370512342::When the whole samovar had been drunk, Rostov took the cards and suggested a game of “kings” with Marya Genrikhovna. They drew lots for who would be Marya Genrikhovna’s partner. The rules of the game were, at Rostov’s suggestion, that whoever was the king had the right to kiss Marya Genrikhovna’s hand, and that whoever was left the knave would go and prepare a new samovar for the doctor when he woke up.::1962-01-10
Franksville::768461.1169928891::“C’est fait!” *259 she said to the count, pointing with a solemn gesture to the countess, who was holding the snuffbox with the portrait in one hand and the letter in the other, and pressing her lips first to the one, then to the other.::1978-12-08

Ashippun::713998.686804045::Two hours after that, Prince Andrei went into his father’s study with quiet steps. The old man already knew everything.

Hutchinson::737247.4501194417::Boris came to the Rostovs’ box, received their felicitations with great simplicity and, raising his eyebrows, with a distracted smile, conveyed to Natasha and Sonya his fianc233;e’s request that they be present at her wedding, and left. Natasha spoke to him with a merry and flirtatious smile, and offered to that same Boris with whom she had once been in love her felicitations on his marriage. In the state of inebriation she was in, everything seemed simple and natural.::1823-08-12
Huntsville::645767.597915979::In the adjoining room, sabers, bags, pouches, open suitcases, dirty boots lay about. Two pairs of polished boots with spurs had just been put near the wall.

Covington::942323.4203010205::“Les souverains? Je ne parle pas de la Russie,”  the viscount said courteously and hopelessly. “Les souverains, madame? Qu’ont-ils fait pour Louis XVI, pour la reine, pour madame Elisabeth? 15 Rien,”  he continued, growing animated. “Et croyez-moi, ils subissent la punition pour leur trahison de la cause des Bourbons.

Borth::326654.3602581048::They fell silent. Prince Andrei looked closely into those mirror-like eyes which did not let anything in, and felt how ridiculous it was that he could have expected anything from Speransky and from all his activity connected with him, and that he could have ascribed importance to what Speransky was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter went on ringing in Prince Andrei’s ears long after he had left Speransky.::1862-02-19
Cornucopia::855739.8670776107::The princess pondered, smiled pensively (at which her face, lit up by her luminous eyes, was completely transformed) and, suddenly getting up, went with her heavy step to the desk. She took out some paper, and her hand quickly began moving across it. This is what she wrote in reply:::1917-01-12
Krakow::268427.73053088743::After this outburst, the prince never once spoke of the matter again. But his suppressed vexation with his son’s faint-heartedness showed itself in the relations between father and daughter. To the previous subjects of mockery a new one was added—talk about stepmothers and his amiability towards Mlle Bourienne.::1806-03-10
Cushing::445004.04158495343::“No, I must treat you to Kuragin,” Bilibin said softly to Bolkonsky. “He’s charming when he argues about politics, you should see such gravity.”::1818-08-07
Bremerton::64747.71301288096::There are two sides to each man’s life: his personal life, which is the more free the more abstract its interests, and his elemental, swarmlike life, where man inevitably fulfills the laws prescribed for him.::1976-04-25

Oakley::263996.93912030733::“He chose his acquaintances poorly,” Princess Anna Mikhailovna mixed in. “Prince Vassily’s son, he and a certain Dolokhov, they say, were up to God knows what. And they’ve both suffered for it. Dolokhov has been broken to the ranks, and Bezukhov’s son has been banished to Moscow. As for Anatole Kuragin—his father somehow hushed it up. But they did banish him from Petersburg.”::1819-11-06
Glidden::102672.05758408338::Soon after that, it was not the rhetor who came into the dark temple for Pierre, but his sponsor Willarski, whom he recognized by his voice. To renewed questions about the firmness of his intentions, Pierre replied:::1980-12-11

Tunnel City::666742.1909182225::“But the doctor hasn’t come from Moscow yet,” said the princess. (At the wishes of Liza and Prince Andrei, they had sent to Moscow in due time for an accoucheur, and he was expected at any moment.)::1865-03-20

Quincy::28448.6253103835::The little princess, waddling, went around the table with small, quick steps, her bag of handwork hanging on her arm, and, cheerfully straightening her dress, sat down on the sofa near the silver samovar, looking as though everything she did was a partie de plaisir *27 for her and for everyone around her.::1816-11-14
Reserve::55538.77380183159::“No, why do you think,” Pierre suddenly began, lowering his head and looking like a butting bull, “why do you think that way? You shouldn’t think that way.”::1847-01-16
Hilton Head Island::834572.749229787::The army moved from west to east, and six-horse relays carried him there as well. On the tenth of June, he caught up with the army and spent the night in the Wilkowiski forest, in quarters prepared for him on the estate of a Polish count.::1859-05-23
Elcho::700867.8381240498::“Consider my position, Pyotr Nikolaich: if I were in the cavalry, I’d get no more than two hundred roubles every four months, even with the rank of sublieutenant; while now I get two hundred and thirty,” he said with a joyful, pleasant smile, looking at Shinshin and the count as though it was obvious to him that his success would always constitute the chief goal of everyone else’s desires.::1919-02-14
Hagerstown::615409.2613694824::“In our temples we know no other distinctions,” the grand master read, “than those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any distinction that may violate equality.

Fitchburg::391599.9556392764::At the beginning of 1806, Nikolai Rostov came home on leave. Denisov also went home to Voronezh, and Rostov persuaded him to come with him as far as Moscow and stay in their house.

Camp Lake::475258.8814974794::“God be with us!” Bagration said in a firm, audible voice, turned for a moment to the front line, and, swinging his arms slightly, with the awkward gait of a cavalryman, as if working at it, he went forward over the uneven field. Prince Andrei felt that some invincible force was drawing him forward, and he experienced great happiness.*223::1801-04-17
San Gabriel::932230.0152500145::Pierre was again overcome by that anguish he feared so much. For three days after delivering his speech at the lodge, he lay at home on the sofa, receiving no one and going nowhere.::1828-01-17
La Puente::809230.9292547061::After Denisov’s departure, Rostov, waiting for the money, which the old count could not raise all at once, spent two more weeks in Moscow without leaving the house, mostly in the young ladies’ room.::1859-08-22
Argonne::56199.46878703342::Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression on the princess’s beautiful little face changed to an attractive and compassion-provoking expression of fear; her pretty eyes glanced from under her eyebrows at her husband, and her face acquired the timid and admissive look of a dog rapidly but weakly wagging its drooping tail.::1827-12-24
Crystal Lake::382147.2361175271::After being relieved from the picket line, Rostov had managed to sleep for a few hours before morning, and he felt cheerful, bold, resolute, with that suppleness of movement, assurance of his good luck, and in that state of mind in which everything seems easy, cheerful, and possible.::1963-08-18
Holyoke::684845.6726430905::“Dieu, quelle virulente sortie!” ‡4 the entering prince replied, not ruffled in the least by such a reception. He was wearing an embroidered court uniform, stockings, shoes, and stars, and had a bright expression on his flat face.::1908-12-07

Carol Stream::98570.33597903232::To the left below, in the fog, exchanges of fire between unseen troops could be heard.

Plat::314701.1146430627::The steward did not say it was completely impossible; to achieve that goal, he suggested selling the woodlands in Kostroma province, selling the bottomlands and the Crimean estate. But all these operations, as the steward spoke of them, became bound up with such a complexity of processes of lifting prohibitions, requesting permissions, and so on, that Pierre was at a loss and only said to him: “Yes, yes, do that.”::1806-11-04
Fish Creek::225718.5378133616::“After Austerlitz!” Prince Andrei said gloomily. “No, I humbly thank you, I promised myself that I would not serve in the active Russian army. And I won’t.

Grove City::84872.21094181108::Old Mikhailo was sleeping on a trunk.

Stevenstown::847240.9955788172::Mlle Bourienne and the little princess had to confess to themselves that as she was Princess Marya looked very bad, worse than ever; but it was already late. She looked at them with that expression they knew, an expression of thought and sadness. This expression did not inspire any fear of Princess Marya in them. (She never inspired that feeling in anyone.) But they knew that when that expression appeared on her face, she became silent and unshakeable in her decisions.::1881-09-12
High Bridge::285123.7725952378::“Listen,” he said, “don’t worry about your wife: whatever can be done, will be done. Now listen: give this letter to Mikhail Ilarionovich. I write that he should use you in good posts and not keep you long as an adjutant: nasty duty! Tell him I remember him and love him. And write and tell me how he receives you. If he’s all right, serve him. Nikolai Andreevich Bolkonsky’s son won’t serve anyone on charity. Well, now come here.”::1934-09-14
Romeoville::622549.6000982019::“What do you want here, Your Honor?” asked the doctor. “What do you want here? The bullet missed you, so you want to catch typhus? This is a pest-house, old boy.”::1836-03-05
Chelsea::372909.9662956925::Prince Vassily looked questioningly, to the point of bewilderment, at her, then at Boris. Boris bowed courteously. Prince Vassily, without responding to the bow, turned to Anna Mikhailovna and replied to her question with a movement of the head and lips signifying the worst hopes for the patient.::1961-07-14
Butte des Morts::676247.752261627::“They don’t even give us time to drink!” replied Vaska Denisov. “They drag the regiment here and there all day. If it’s fighting, it’s fighting. Or else devil knows what it is!”::2005-11-19
Monches::224664.70808821116::“Capital!” Prince Ippolit said in English and began slapping his knee with his palm. The viscount merely shrugged.::1979-09-20
Marlborough::857647.2409607397::Reading this passage, Pierre felt for the first time that between him and H233;l232;ne some sort of connection had been formed, recognized by other people, and this thought at the same time frightened him, as if an obligation had been laid upon him which he could not fulfill, and also pleased him as an amusing supposition.::1848-07-18
New Post::977449.7154120681::Carousers, those male Magdalenes, have a hidden sense of awareness of their innocence, just as female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope of forgiveness. “Everything will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and everything will be forgiven him, for he had much fun.”11::1935-10-04
Cape Girardeau::403594.2377059607::“But I precisely wish to tell you, so as to avoid misunderstandings, that you are greatly mistaken if you count my mother and me among those people. We’re very poor, but I can speak for myself at least: precisely because your father is rich, I don’t consider myself his relation, and neither I nor my mother will ever ask for or accept anything from him.”::1856-06-16
Norwich::7791.738075612841::“What can you tell me, Prince, about my Boris?” she said, overtaking him in the front hall. (She pronounced the name Boris with a special emphasis on the o .) “I cannot remain in Petersburg any longer. Tell me, what news can I bring my poor boy?”::1827-10-15
Hallandale Beach::19435.061339095115::They fell silent. Prince Andrei looked closely into those mirror-like eyes which did not let anything in, and felt how ridiculous it was that he could have expected anything from Speransky and from all his activity connected with him, and that he could have ascribed importance to what Speransky was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter went on ringing in Prince Andrei’s ears long after he had left Speransky.::1952-01-05
Duncanville::556944.7746692231::It was past three o’clock in the afternoon when Prince Andrei, who had persuaded Kutuzov to grant his request, arrived in Grunt and went to Bagration. Bonaparte’s adjutant had not yet reached Murat’s division, and the battle had not yet begun. In Bagration’s division, nothing was known about the general course of affairs; they talked of peace, but did not believe in its possibility. They talked of battle and also did not believe in the nearness of battle.::1960-02-10
Saint Peter::196141.277786703::“Let me, miss, let me,” said the maid, getting on her knees, pulling at the dress, and moving the pins with her tongue from one side of her mouth to the other.::1929-04-09
Downsville::360530.11229275045::“Well, dear princess, here I’ve brought you my singer,” said the count, scraping and looking around uneasily, as if fearing the old prince might walk in. “I’m so glad you’ll be getting acquainted. A pity, a pity the prince is unwell,” and, having said a few more general phrases, he got up. “If you will permit me, Princess, to deposit my Natasha here for a quarter of an hour, I’ll drive over to the Dogs’ Square, just two steps away, to see Anna Semyonovna, and come back for her.”::1892-12-20
Schertz::935744.3223513229::The night he received this information, Kutuzov sent Bagration’s four-thousand-man vanguard to the right over the hills from the Krems–Znaim to the Vienna–Znaim road. Bagration was to make this march without resting, to stop with his face to Vienna and his back to Znaim, and, if he managed to forestall the French, to detain them there as long as he could. Kutuzov himself started out for Znaim with all the heavy baggage.::1952-01-20
Woburn::250271.4641683924::Pierre took off his spectacles, and his eyes, on top of the general strangeness of people’s eyes when they take off their spectacles, had a frightened and questioning look. He was about to bend down to her hand and kiss it; but she, with a quick and crude movement of her head, intercepted his lips and brought them together with her own. Her face struck Pierre by its altered, unpleasantly perplexed expression.::1842-06-16
Annapolis::778916.0058586259::“Look out!” he cried in a voice which made it clear that this word had been asking long and painfully to be let out. And, releasing his dogs, he galloped towards the count.::1836-11-05
